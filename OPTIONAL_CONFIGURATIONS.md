# Optional Configurations

This guide covers optional customizations you can make after completing the initial setup from either of the two getting started guides:

- **[Creating a New Repository](GETTING_STARTED_NEW_REPO.md)**: For users creating new repositories from this template
- **[Adding Template Features to an Existing Repository](GETTING_STARTED_EXISTING_REPO.md)**: For users adopting template features into existing repositories

> **Note:** None of these configurations are required. Your repository will work correctly with the default settings. These options allow you to fine-tune your setup based on your project's specific needs.

## First-Adoption Preflight Answers

The getting-started guides require a root `_TODO-repo-init.md` checklist during first-time adoption when maintainer choices are not already recorded. This section describes optional answers that often affect later configuration. These answers are optional because repositories may choose different settings, not because agents may guess them.

Use file inspection and Git metadata only for discoverable repository state. Record manual GitHub settings and maintainer policy decisions in `_TODO-repo-init.md`, `.template-sync/marker.yml`, or an equivalent committed adoption note named by the adoption procedure before treating them as resolved.

| Preflight answer | Category | Follow-up configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enable GitHub Discussions | Manual GitHub setting | If enabled, uncomment the Discussions contact link in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` and confirm the `OWNER/REPO` or GHES host substitution. |
| Create `triage` or other expected labels | Manual GitHub setting | Create labels in GitHub before uncommenting label entries in issue templates. |
| Enable private vulnerability reporting | Manual GitHub setting | Public repositories may enable it under Settings > Security. After enabling, update `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` and `SECURITY.md` to use the direct advisory-reporting path if desired. |
| Configure default-branch protection or rulesets | Manual GitHub setting plus maintainer policy | Enable protection for the repository default branch, normally `main`, according to maintainer or organization policy. Do not infer required checks or approval counts from this template. |
| Choose Code of Conduct reporting contact | Maintainer policy decision | Replace `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` only with a confirmed monitored channel. |
| Choose security reporting channel | Maintainer policy decision | Select `github-private-only`, `contact-only`, or `both` and provide a monitored security contact when the selected mode includes contact-based reporting. |
| Choose CODEOWNERS owner/team identity | Maintainer policy decision | Replace `@OWNER` with the confirmed user or team. Organization team slugs must be confirmed by the repository owner or maintainers. |
| Choose adoption mode for template-derived files | Maintainer policy decision | Use `minimal-preservation` by default for protected files and template-derived governance, community, process, workflow, and collaboration files. Record explicit `tailored` opt-ins for named files or file sets before broader rewriting. Use `.template-sync/marker.yml` `local_overrides` for path-specific sync defaults when future sync support is adopted. |
| Record a GHES host override | Maintainer policy decision | Replace `github.com` in absolute template URLs only when the repository is hosted on the confirmed GitHub Enterprise Server host. |

Agents MUST NOT invent contact emails, reporting channels, branch protection policy, label existence, private vulnerability reporting state, Discussions state, GHES host names, or adoption modes beyond the documented default. Downstream work may assume a preflight item is done only after it is recorded as resolved in `_TODO-repo-init.md`, `.template-sync/marker.yml`, or the equivalent committed adoption note named by the adoption procedure.

This preflight is gated to first-time adoption or missing first-adoption state. Ongoing initialized delta syncs MUST NOT re-ask questions that are already resolved in one of those records.

---

## Adoption Mode Opt-Ins

`minimal-preservation` is the default for protected files and template-derived governance, community, process, workflow, and collaboration files. In this mode, keep upstream wording and structure; substitute placeholders, remove complete delimited sections owned by unadopted manifest modules, fix broken links, and record required local overrides in `.template-sync/marker.yml`.

Choose `tailored` only when the maintainer explicitly wants broader downstream rewriting for a specific file or file set. Legitimate opt-ins include:

- Existing issue or PR templates with established fields, labels, or project-specific review checklists that must be merged with the template rather than preserved verbatim.
- Community-health files such as `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, or `CONTRIBUTING.md` when the downstream project has confirmed local policy text that goes beyond placeholder substitution.
- Workflow files that need repository-specific runner labels, cache strategy, required checks, or secret names after the retained modules are known.
- Root README or onboarding guides that become downstream-owned product documentation after initial adoption.
- Protected instruction files only after the maintainer separately grants explicit path-scoped protected-file authorization.

The tradeoff is sync drift: `tailored` files are easier to make project-specific, but future upstream template changes require more manual review and may need path-specific `local_overrides`. Selecting `tailored` MUST NOT weaken security, validation, or pre-commit expectations, and it does not bypass protected-file authorization.

Record the choice in `_TODO-repo-init.md`, `.template-sync/marker.yml` local overrides, or another committed adoption note before editing. If no explicit opt-in is recorded, agents should apply `minimal-preservation` without repeatedly prompting.

---

## Issue Template Configuration

**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`

### Requiring Issue Templates

By default, `blank_issues_enabled` is set to `true`, which allows users to create issues without selecting a template. This provides flexibility for edge cases that don't fit your predefined templates.

**To require template usage:**

```yaml
blank_issues_enabled: false
```

> **Recommendation:** Set this to `false` once you have comprehensive templates covering all issue types and want structured data collection for better triage.

### Enabling GitHub Discussions Link

If your repository uses GitHub Discussions for Q&A and general discussions, you can add a link that redirects users away from the issue tracker.

**Steps:**

1. Enable GitHub Discussions in your repository:
   - Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Features**
   - Check the **Discussions** checkbox
2. Uncomment the Discussions contact link in `config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   - name: 💬 Questions & Discussions
     url: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/discussions
     about: Ask questions and discuss ideas (not for bug reports)
   ```

3. Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your actual organization and repository name

### Adding a Support/FAQ Link

If you prefer not to enable Discussions but want to redirect support questions away from issues:

**Steps:**

1. Add a `## Support` section to your `README.md` with FAQs and support guidance
2. Uncomment the Support/FAQ contact link in `config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   - name: ❓ Support / FAQ
     url: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO#support
     about: Common questions, FAQs, and support guidance
   ```

3. Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your actual values
4. Update the URL anchor (`#support`) if your section has a different heading

### Security Link URL Customization

The placeholder helper renders the `config.yml` security contact link to point at `SECURITY.md` for **every** security reporting mode:

```yaml
- name: Security Vulnerabilities
  url: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob/HEAD/SECURITY.md
  about: Report security issues privately using the instructions in SECURITY.md. Do not open a public issue.
```

`SECURITY.md` is always reachable and is itself rendered from the selected mode, so it documents the appropriate reporting path:

- `github-private-only` and `both` render the GitHub private vulnerability reporting form (and, for `both`, a security contact) inside `SECURITY.md`.
- `contact-only` renders the security contact instructions inside `SECURITY.md`.

Pointing the issue chooser at `SECURITY.md` keeps the link working throughout the repository lifecycle: a direct advisory-form link cannot receive reports until a maintainer enables private vulnerability reporting, so the chooser would otherwise send reporters to a non-functional page on newly created or private repositories.

> **Important:** Private vulnerability reporting is only available for **public repositories** and must be enabled in GitHub settings before the direct advisory form (linked from `SECURITY.md`) can receive reports. Private repositories or public repositories that do not enable the feature should use `contact-only` or `both` with a monitored security contact.
>
> **See:** [Security Configuration](#security-configuration) for instructions on enabling private vulnerability reporting.

### Bug Report Template Customization

**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`

The bug report template includes numerous `# CUSTOMIZE:` comments indicating optional configuration points. This section documents each customization option.

#### Top-Level Metadata

##### Title Prefix

Adjust the issue title prefix to match your project's conventions:

```yaml
# Default:
title: "[Bug] "

# Example alternatives:
title: "bug: "
title: "[BUG] "
title: ""  # No prefix
```

##### Labels

Update the labels to match your repository's label taxonomy. Ensure labels exist before using them:

```yaml
labels:
  - bug
  # Add your project-specific labels:
  # - priority:high
  # - area:api
```

> **Note:** Labels must exist in your repository before they can be applied. Create them via **Settings** > **Labels** or use the GitHub CLI.

##### Triage Label

Uncomment the `triage` label after creating it in your repository:

```yaml
labels:
  - bug
  - triage  # Uncomment after creating the label
```

> **Cross-reference:** The [Getting Started Guides](GETTING_STARTED_NEW_REPO.md) provide instructions for creating labels in your repository.

##### Issue Type (Organization-Level)

For organizations using [GitHub issue types](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms#top-level-syntax), uncomment and configure the `type` field:

```yaml
# Uncomment to enable:
type: Bug
```

##### Assignees

Pre-populate the assignees field for bug reports:

```yaml
# Uncomment and update:
assignees:
  - maintainer-username
  - your-github-handle
```

##### Projects

Auto-add bug reports to a GitHub Project (uses project number):

```yaml
# Uncomment and update with your org and project number:
projects:
  - org/1
```

#### Pre-flight Checklist Customization

##### Making Documentation Check Required

For projects with comprehensive documentation that users should consult before filing bugs:

```yaml
# Change from:
- label: I have read the project documentation
  required: false

# To:
- label: I have read the project documentation
  required: true
```

##### Removing PR Contribution Checkbox

For projects that don't accept community contributions, remove this checkbox:

```yaml
# Remove this block entirely:
- label: I am willing to submit a pull request to fix this issue
  required: false
```

#### Environment Fields Customization

##### Area Dropdown

The Area dropdown is optional by default for template portability. Update the options to match your project's components:

```yaml
options:
  - Backend / API
  - Frontend / UI
  - CLI
  - Documentation
  - Other (describe/specify in Additional Context)
```

**Making it required:** For repos that rely on area-based routing, change `required: false` to `required: true`.

##### Minimal Reproduction URL

For library or framework projects, consider making this field required:

```yaml
# Change from:
validations:
  required: false

# To:
validations:
  required: true
```

Projects that don't accept external reproductions can remove this field entirely.

##### Architecture Dropdown

For cross-platform projects, consider making this required:

```yaml
# Change from:
validations:
  required: false

# To:
validations:
  required: true
```

Single-platform projects can remove this field entirely.

##### Runtime Version Placeholders

Update the placeholder examples to match your project's supported runtimes:

```yaml
# Default (Python-focused):
placeholder: |
  Python 3.14.2 (or your installed supported version)
  PowerShell 7.4.6 or Windows PowerShell 5.1
  Markdown tooling/renderer (if relevant): e.g., Pandoc 3.1.2

# Node.js project example:
placeholder: |
  Node.js 24.x
  npm 11.x

# .NET project example:
placeholder: |
  .NET 8.0.1
  C# 12
```

##### Shell/Terminal Field

For non-CLI projects where shell environment isn't relevant, remove this field entirely.

##### How Did You Run It? Placeholders

Update the placeholder examples to match your project's dependency management approach:

```yaml
# Default (Python-focused):
placeholder: |
  # Python (using pyproject.toml)
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -e .
  python -m your_package

# Node.js example:
placeholder: |
  npm install
  npm run build
  npm start

# Docker example:
placeholder: |
  docker build -t myapp .
  docker run myapp
```

#### Bug Characteristics Customization

##### Regression Fields

For projects where version history or regression tracking is not relevant, remove these fields:

- Remove the "Regression?" dropdown (`id: regression`)
- Remove the "Last Working Version" input (`id: last_working_version`)

##### Severity Options

Adjust the severity levels to match your project's triage workflow:

```yaml
# Default:
options:
  - Critical (system crash, data loss)
  - High (major feature broken, no workaround)
  - Medium (feature impaired, workaround exists)
  - Low (minor inconvenience, cosmetic issue)

# Alternative with P-levels:
options:
  - P0 (production down)
  - P1 (critical impact)
  - P2 (moderate impact)
  - P3 (low impact)
```

#### Additional Information Customization

##### Related Issues Placeholder

Update the cross-repo example to reference related projects in your ecosystem:

```yaml
# Default:
placeholder: |
  #123
  owner/repo-name#456

# Example for a monorepo or related projects:
placeholder: |
  #123
  my-org/frontend#456
  my-org/backend#789
```

### Feature Request Template Customization

**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`

The feature request template shares many customization points with the bug report template. This section documents the unique or different options.

#### Top-Level Metadata

The same customizations apply as for the bug report template:

- **Title Prefix:** Default is `"[Feature] "`
- **Labels:** Default is `enhancement`
- **Triage Label:** Uncomment after creating the label
- **Issue Type:** Use `type: Feature` for organization-level issue types
- **Assignees and Projects:** Same configuration as bug reports

#### Shared Customizations with Bug Report

The feature request template shares several customization points with the bug report template. See the [Bug Report Template Customization](#bug-report-template-customization) section for detailed instructions on:

- **Making Documentation Check Required:** Change `required: false` to `required: true` for the "I have read the project documentation" checkbox
- **Area Dropdown Options:** Update the options to match your project's languages/components (e.g., Backend / API, Frontend / UI, CLI, etc.)

> **Tip:** Keep the Area dropdown options consistent between bug report and feature request templates to maintain a unified user experience.

#### Pre-flight Checklist

##### Removing PR Contribution Checkbox

Same as the bug report template—remove if your project doesn't accept community contributions:

```yaml
# Remove this block:
- label: I am willing to submit a pull request to implement this feature
  required: false
```

#### Feature Classification

##### Priority Options

Adjust priority levels to match your project's triage workflow:

```yaml
# Default:
options:
  - Critical (blocking my adoption/usage)
  - High (significant impact on my workflow)
  - Medium (would improve my experience)
  - Low (nice to have)
```

##### Scope Options

Adjust feature scope categories as needed:

```yaml
# Default:
options:
  - Major feature (new capability, significant change)
  - Minor enhancement (improvement to existing feature)
  - Quality of life (small improvement, polish)
```

### Documentation Issue Template Customization

**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation_issue.yml`

The documentation issue template is simpler than the other templates but still has customization points.

#### Top-Level Metadata

- **Title Prefix:** Default is `"[Docs] "`
- **Labels:** Default is `documentation` (a GitHub default label)
- **Triage Label:** Uncomment after creating the label

> **Note:** The `documentation` label is a GitHub default label that exists in all new repositories. If your organization has renamed or deleted it, update accordingly.

#### Location Placeholder URL

The "Where is it?" field includes a generic placeholder that uses relative file paths:

```yaml
placeholder: e.g., README.md#usage or docs/guide.md
```

For a more helpful user experience, you can update this placeholder to include a full URL example specific to your repository:

```yaml
placeholder: e.g., https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/blob/HEAD/README.md#usage or docs/guide.md
```

Replace `your-org/your-repo` with your actual organization and repository name.

> **Note:** The default uses simple file paths rather than full URLs to avoid reporters pasting literal placeholders. Updating this is optional and depends on your preference for guiding reporters.

#### Documentation Version Field

For projects that don't maintain versioned documentation, remove this field:

```yaml
# Remove this entire block:
- type: input
  id: doc_version
  attributes:
    label: Documentation Version (optional)
    description: >-
      If the documentation is versioned, which version are you viewing?
    placeholder: e.g., v1.2.3, latest, main branch
  validations:
    required: false
```

#### Issue Type Dropdown

Adjust the documentation issue type options to match your documentation structure:

```yaml
# Default:
options:
  - Typo / Grammar
  - Unclear / Confusing
  - Missing Information
  - Broken Link
  - Outdated Information
  - Code Example Issue
  - Formatting / Rendering
  - Other

# Simplified example:
options:
  - Typo / Grammar
  - Missing or Outdated Content
  - Broken Link
  - Other
```

To make this field required for structured documentation triage, change `required: false` to `required: true`.

## Security Configuration

**Files:** `SECURITY.md` and repository settings

### Enabling Private Vulnerability Reporting

> **Important:** Private vulnerability reporting is **only available for public repositories**.

Private vulnerability reporting allows security researchers to report vulnerabilities directly to maintainers without public disclosure.

**Steps:**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Private vulnerability reporting**
2. Click **Enable**

**Optional:** After enabling, run the placeholder helper with `--security-reporting-mode github-private-only` or `--security-reporting-mode both` so `SECURITY.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`, and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` are rendered consistently for the selected mode. The rendered `SECURITY.md` links to the private vulnerability reporting form:

```text
https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/security/advisories/new
```

The issue-template chooser link always points at `SECURITY.md` (see [Security Link URL Customization](#security-link-url-customization)), which is always reachable and surfaces this advisory form once enabled — so you do not edit `config.yml` to use the advisory URL directly.

If you keep a contact fallback, use a monitored project or organization contact method. Do not use a `users.noreply.github.com` address as a real security contact channel.

### Customizing Supported Versions

The default `SECURITY.md` includes a minimal supported versions table:

```markdown
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
```

**To customize for your versioning policy:**

```markdown
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |
```

Update this table to reflect which versions of your project receive security updates.

---

## Code of Conduct Configuration

**File:** `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

The template includes the Contributor Covenant v3.0, a widely-adopted code of conduct for open source projects. This section covers customization options and alternatives.

### Alternative Code of Conduct Templates

While the Contributor Covenant is the most widely used code of conduct for open source, you may choose a different template based on your project's needs:

| Template | Description | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Contributor Covenant v3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/) | Comprehensive, widely recognized | Most open source projects (template default) |
| [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md) | Community-focused, detailed examples | Projects emphasizing community building |
| Organization-specific | Custom policies matching org standards | Enterprise or organizational projects |

**To use a different template:**

1. Replace the contents of `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` with your chosen template
2. Update any contact information or placeholders
3. Review enforcement procedures and adjust as needed

### Customizing Enforcement Procedures

The default enforcement section includes a four-tier ladder (Warning → Temporarily Limited Activities → Temporary Suspension → Permanent Ban). You may customize this based on your project's needs:

#### Enforcement Contact Information

Replace `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` with your preferred reporting method:

```markdown
To report a possible violation, contact us via: conduct@your-project.org
```

**Contact method options:**

- **Email address:** Simple, widely understood, but requires email monitoring
- **Web form:** Provides structured reporting, can integrate with issue tracking
- **Multiple channels:** List several options (email, form, direct message to maintainers)
- **Repository owner profile links:** Suitable for small projects when the repository owners have monitored contact links on their GitHub profiles

Do not use a `users.noreply.github.com` address as a code-of-conduct contact. It is suitable for commit attribution privacy, not for receiving sensitive community reports.

#### Response Timeline Commitments

Consider adding explicit timeline commitments to the enforcement section:

```markdown
Community Moderators will acknowledge receipt of reports within 48 hours and
aim to provide a resolution within 7 days for straightforward cases. Complex
cases may require additional time, and reporters will be updated on progress.
```

#### Scope Customization

The default scope section covers community spaces and official representation. Customize based on your project's context:

```markdown
## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within:

- All repository spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project communication channels (Slack, Discord, mailing lists)
- Project events (meetups, conferences, online gatherings)
- When representing the project in public spaces
```

### Removing the Code of Conduct

Small personal projects or projects that don't accept external contributions may not need a code of conduct file.

**To remove:**

1. Delete `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` from your repository
2. The placeholder check workflow will continue to pass—`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` is treated as optional

**Considerations before removing:**

- Projects that grow to accept contributions later may want to add one
- Some organizations require a code of conduct for all projects
- Having a code of conduct signals that your project welcomes diverse contributors

---

## Pull Request Template Customization

**File:** `.github/pull_request_template.md`

### Strengthening Pre-commit Language

The default template uses conditional language for pre-commit verification:

```markdown
### Pre-commit Verification (if configured)

- [ ] If this repository uses pre-commit, I ran `pre-commit run --all-files` and all checks pass
- [ ] If pre-commit made auto-fixes, I reviewed and committed them
```

**If your repository uses pre-commit hooks**, replace with direct language:

```markdown
### Pre-commit Verification

- [ ] I have run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally and all checks pass
- [ ] I have reviewed and committed all auto-fixes made by pre-commit hooks
```

### Adding Language-Specific Sections

Add checklist sections for your project's technology stack:

**Node.js/TypeScript:**

```markdown
### Node.js-Specific (if applicable)

- [ ] `npm test` passes locally
- [ ] ESLint passes with no errors
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
```

**.NET:**

```markdown
### .NET-Specific (if applicable)

- [ ] `dotnet test` passes locally
- [ ] No compiler warnings
- [ ] Code analysis passes
```

**Go:**

```markdown
### Go-Specific (if applicable)

- [ ] `go test ./...` passes locally
- [ ] `go vet ./...` passes
- [ ] `golint ./...` passes (if using golint)
```

**Rust:**

```markdown
### Rust-Specific (if applicable)

- [ ] `cargo test` passes locally
- [ ] `clippy` passes with no warnings
- [ ] `cargo fmt --check` shows no formatting issues
```

**Java:**

```markdown
### Java-Specific (if applicable)

- [ ] Maven/Gradle tests pass locally
- [ ] Checkstyle passes
- [ ] No compiler warnings
```

### Adjusting the Data-File-Specific Pull Request Checklist

The default PR template includes a `### Data-File-Specific (if applicable)` section that prompts contributors to verify the data-file definition-of-done items documented in [`.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/json.instructions.md), [`.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md), and the **Data-File Validation** subsection of [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md). The default checklist covers the baseline pre-commit hooks (`check-json`, `check-yaml`, `yamllint`, `actionlint`, `check-jsonschema`, `check-metaschema`), schema-fixture parity, the schema example tests under `tests/test_schema_examples.py`, GitHub Actions workflow linting, `check-jsonschema` hook bookkeeping, and a normative no-secrets/PII/credentials rule.

The no-secrets/PII/credentials bullet in this section is a high-visibility, data-file-specific reminder. Its secrets and credentials portion echoes the **No secrets in code or repo** rule from [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) (the constitution); the PII portion is an additional precaution that this template's PR checklist layers on top of the constitution and is not separately defined as a repo-wide rule in the constitution today. The General checklist carries its own no-secrets/PII/credentials bullet, so even if this Data-File-Specific section is removed downstream, the General-checklist bullet remains in force. When this section is present, the data-file-specific bullet **MUST** remain in the template and **MUST** be checked before the PR is submitted. The other bullets in this section **MAY** be customized as described below.

#### Removing the Section Entirely

Most repositories will not need to remove this section, because GitHub Actions workflows alone are YAML and the section's pre-commit and `actionlint` bullets apply to any repository that ships at least one workflow file. **Removal is appropriate only for repositories that commit no JSON, no YAML (including no GitHub Actions workflows), and no schema files at all.**

If your repository genuinely commits no JSON or YAML files of any kind, delete the entire `### Data-File-Specific (if applicable)` block (heading, HTML comment, and all checklist items) from `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The General checklist still carries its own no-secrets/PII/credentials bullet, so the practical effect of the data-file-specific bullet (catching accidental secret, PII, or credential leakage at PR time) is preserved. If you have customized the General checklist in a way that drops or weakens that bullet, you **MUST** restore an equivalent no-secrets/PII/credentials checklist item to the General section (or another retained section) before removing the Data-File-Specific section.

#### Tightening the "if applicable" Language

For repositories where data files are central to the project (for example, schema-driven configuration repositories, GitHub Actions monorepos, infrastructure-as-data repositories, or repositories with a large `schemas/` tree), replace the conditional heading and HTML comment with direct language. Change:

```markdown
### Data-File-Specific (if applicable)

<!-- Delete this section if your project does not commit JSON, YAML, GitHub Actions workflows, or schema files. Note that GitHub Actions workflows alone are YAML, so this section will apply to most repositories. The General checklist retains its own no-secrets/PII/credentials bullet regardless of whether this section is removed. -->
```

To:

```markdown
### Data-File Verification
```

You **MAY** also remove the leading conditional qualifiers on individual bullets (for example, the ``If a schema under `schemas/` was modified`` and `If a GitHub Actions workflow was modified` prefixes) when those file families are always in scope for changes in your repository.

#### Adding Downstream Ecosystem-Specific Checklist Bullets

When your repository commits ecosystem-specific data files and you have opted into the matching validator (see [Ecosystem-Specific YAML Validators (Opt-in)](#ecosystem-specific-yaml-validators-opt-in)), append additional checklist bullets so contributors are prompted to run the ecosystem validator before opening a PR.

These bullets are **opt-in**: do **not** add them unless your repository actually commits files of that type **and** has wired up the corresponding validator (in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, CI, or both). Adding ecosystem bullets without the matching tooling produces noise and false confidence.

**Kubernetes manifests (`kubeconform`):**

```markdown
- [ ] If a Kubernetes manifest under `manifests/` (or your repository's manifest directory) was modified, `kubeconform` passes
```

**OpenAPI specifications (`spectral`):**

```markdown
- [ ] If an OpenAPI specification was modified, `spectral lint` passes against the project's ruleset
```

**CloudFormation templates (`cfn-lint`):**

```markdown
- [ ] If a CloudFormation template was modified, `cfn-lint` passes
```

**Ansible playbooks/roles (`ansible-lint`):**

```markdown
- [ ] If an Ansible playbook or role was modified, `ansible-lint` passes
```

**Helm charts (`helm lint`):**

```markdown
- [ ] If a Helm chart under `charts/` (or your repository's chart directory) was modified, `helm lint` passes
```

These ecosystem validators are intentionally **not** part of the default `.pre-commit-config.yaml` shipped with this template; see the [Ecosystem-Specific YAML Validators (Opt-in)](#ecosystem-specific-yaml-validators-opt-in) section in this guide for the rationale and adoption guidance.

### Customizing Type of Change Options

Add options relevant to your workflow:

```markdown
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [ ] Security fix
- [ ] Performance improvement
```

Remove options that don't apply to your project.

### Strengthening Test Requirements

For mature projects with established test infrastructure, change:

```markdown
- [ ] I have added or updated tests where appropriate
```

To:

```markdown
- [ ] I have added tests for all new functionality
- [ ] I have updated tests for all modified functionality
```

### Contributing Guidelines Link

The default PR template uses an absolute URL for the contributing guidelines link:

```markdown
[contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

`OWNER/REPO` follows this template's placeholder convention. Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your actual organization and repository name as part of template adoption. If you keep `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml` (an optional adoption step), CI will fail until this substitution is made; if you do not adopt that workflow or you remove it after initial setup, no CI guardrail catches a missed substitution and you must verify the replacement manually.

**GHES adopters:** The `github.com` host is the assumed default and is **not** validated by `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml`. If your repository is hosted on GitHub Enterprise Server, you **MUST** also replace `github.com` with your GHES host (e.g., `github.company.com`); otherwise the link will point off-instance to GitHub.com.

This is the canonical link form for files under `.github/` (issue forms and the PR template); see the **Issue and PR templates** carve-out in `.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md` for the full rule. Relative forms such as `../blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md` or `blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md` MUST NOT be used in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml` or `.github/pull_request_template.md`, because they either 404 in issue-form `value:` blocks or render unreliably across non-GitHub.com renderers, GitHub Mobile, and email notifications.

**If your CONTRIBUTING.md is in a different location** (e.g., `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`), update the path inside the absolute URL accordingly:

```markdown
[contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob/HEAD/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

### Customizing Additional Notes Section

The "Additional Notes" section provides PR authors a place to add context for reviewers that doesn't fit elsewhere. Consider adding prompts for common needs:

```markdown
## Additional Notes

<!-- Add any additional context, such as: -->
<!-- - Migration steps (for breaking changes) -->
<!-- - Deployment considerations -->
<!-- - Rollback instructions -->
```

### Customizing Related Issues Section

The template uses `Closes #` for linking to issues. Update the syntax if your project uses different keywords:

| Keyword | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Closes OWNER/REPO#123` | Closes the issue when PR is merged (default) |
| `Fixes OWNER/REPO#123` | Alternative keyword, same effect |
| `Resolves OWNER/REPO#123` | Alternative keyword, same effect |

Choose one keyword and use it consistently across your project.

## Dependabot Configuration

**File:** `.github/dependabot.yml`

This section configures GitHub Dependabot for repositories that retain the GitHub platform module. Dependabot configuration in `.github/dependabot.yml` is a GitHub-hosted dependency update surface; it does not configure Azure DevOps-native dependency scanning or Azure DevOps routine dependency version updates.

### Adjusting Update Frequency

The default configuration checks for updates weekly:

```yaml
schedule:
  interval: "weekly"
```

**Options:**

- `"daily"`: More frequent updates, useful for security-critical projects
- `"weekly"`: Balanced approach (default)
- `"monthly"`: Less frequent updates, reduces PR volume

### Adjusting PR Limits

The `open-pull-requests-limit` controls how many Dependabot PRs can be open simultaneously:

```yaml
open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

- **Increase** if you have a large dependency tree and want faster updates
- **Decrease** if Dependabot PRs are overwhelming your team

### Adding Automatic Assignees

Automatically assign Dependabot PRs to users:

```yaml
- package-ecosystem: "npm"
  directory: "/"
  schedule:
    interval: "weekly"
  assignees:
    - "username2"
```

The `assignees` field shown here is accepted by the pinned `check-jsonschema` `vendor.dependabot` schema, so it passes the default `validate-dependabot-config` pre-commit hook once added to your real [`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml) (the hook is path-scoped to that file and does not scan this snippet). The matching fixture at [`tests/fixtures/dependabot/auto-assignment.yml`](tests/fixtures/dependabot/auto-assignment.yml) is validated by the regression test at [`tests/test_dependabot_schema.py`](tests/test_dependabot_schema.py), which pins its `check-jsonschema` to the same version as the pre-commit hook (and fails if the two drift) so it exercises the same bundled `vendor.dependabot` schema the hook enforces. Do not add a `reviewers:` key to this example: the pinned `vendor.dependabot` schema rejects it, and the current GitHub.com [Dependabot options reference](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference) documents `assignees` but not `reviewers`.

### Customizing Commit Message Prefixes

The default prefix is `chore(deps)`:

```yaml
commit-message:
  prefix: "chore(deps)"
```

**To match your project's commit conventions:**

```yaml
commit-message:
  prefix: "deps"           # Simpler prefix
  prefix: "build(deps)"    # For projects using build scope
  prefix: "fix(deps)"      # If you treat dependency updates as fixes
```

### Consolidating Multiple Directories That Share an Ecosystem

This template repository's own `.github/dependabot.yml` does not currently exercise this pattern: every active entry uses `directory: "/"`. The guidance below is forward-looking advice for downstream adopters whose repositories contain multiple directories that share a single dependency ecosystem (for example, several Terraform stages, sibling npm workspaces, or multiple Python packages) and that are intended to stay aligned under the same dependency-update policy.

**Rules:**

- When multiple directories share the same dependency ecosystem and are intended to use the same dependency-update policy, they **SHOULD** be configured under a single Dependabot update entry using the `directories:` plural form rather than one update entry per directory. Consolidating these directories under a single entry helps reduce redundant dependency-update PRs and keeps related directories aligned on the same dependency versions.
- The single multi-directory entry **SHOULD** define `groups:` for routine minor and patch updates so related updates are consolidated according to the configured grouping policy. The exact PR shape Dependabot produces depends on the configured group patterns and update types; adopters **SHOULD NOT** assume Dependabot will always create exactly one PR per dependency.
- Each directory **SHOULD** be listed explicitly in `directories:` when the tracked set is small and intentional, so maintainers can see at a glance which directories are included and which are intentionally excluded.
- Glob patterns **MAY** be used when the directory set is genuinely open-ended, but adopters **SHOULD** weigh the trade-off: glob patterns are less explicit than an enumerated list and can be harder to audit when reviewing why a particular directory is or is not covered.
- Directories that do not contain a manifest or configuration file for the ecosystem **MUST** be omitted from `directories:`. If the omission could be surprising to a future maintainer (for example, a sibling directory that looks like it should match but intentionally does not), a YAML comment **SHOULD** explain why the path is excluded so the directory is not added back by mistake.

**Hypothetical downstream repository example.** The directory paths shown below (`/infra/stage-a`, `/infra/stage-b`, `/infra/stage-c`, `/infra/bootstrap`) are illustrative only and do not correspond to paths in this template repository; substitute the actual directories from your own project.

```yaml
# Hypothetical downstream repository example.
- package-ecosystem: "terraform"
  directories:
    - "/infra/stage-a"
    - "/infra/stage-b"
    - "/infra/stage-c"
    # /infra/bootstrap omitted: contains helper scripts only, no Terraform configuration.
  schedule:
    interval: "weekly"
  groups:
    terraform-minor-patch:
      patterns:
        - "*"
      update-types:
        - "minor"
        - "patch"
  commit-message:
    prefix: "chore(deps)"
  open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

## Azure DevOps Security and Dependency Automation

Azure DevOps support in this template means Azure DevOps Services. Azure DevOps Server behavior must be separately verified against current Microsoft documentation before documenting server-specific claims.

<!-- template-sync: begin azure-devops-guide-reference-only -->
See the durable [Azure DevOps Services Support Guide](docs/azure-devops-support.md) for host-wide Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines, Azure Boards, security scanning, dependency-update, and validation boundaries.
<!-- template-sync: end azure-devops-guide-reference-only -->

Security scanning and routine dependency version updates are separate capabilities:

- GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps, or the standalone GitHub Secret Protection for Azure DevOps and GitHub Code Security for Azure DevOps products, can provide security scanning for Azure Repos when licensed, enabled, and configured.
- Routine dependency version updates are an explicit adopter choice and require a separate Azure-compatible mechanism. This template does not enable Renovate, self-hosted Dependabot, or another dependency-update service by default.

Product naming verified against Microsoft Learn on 2026-06-22:

- The bundled [GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/security/configure-github-advanced-security-features?view=azure-devops) feature set covers secret scanning push protection, repository secret scanning, dependency scanning, and code scanning.
- [GitHub Secret Protection for Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/security/configure-github-advanced-security-features?view=azure-devops) covers push protection and secret scanning.
- [GitHub Code Security for Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/security/configure-github-advanced-security-features?view=azure-devops) covers dependency alerts/scanning, CodeQL/code scanning, third-party findings, and the security overview.

Dependency scanning behavior verified against Microsoft Learn on 2026-06-22:

- [Dependency scanning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/security/github-advanced-security-dependency-scanning?view=azure-devops) requires either a pipeline configured with `AdvancedSecurity-Dependency-Scanning@1` or a repository with dependency scanning default setup enabled.
- Enabling Advanced Security or Code Security alone does not execute dependency scanning automatically.
- Default setup can cover the default branch and pull request builds targeting that branch; broader or more controlled coverage uses the [Advanced Security Dependency Scanning v1 task](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/advanced-security-dependency-scanning-v1?view=azure-pipelines) in the pipelines that should be scanned.
- Microsoft still lists automatic Dependabot security-update PRs for Azure DevOps dependency scanning alerts as a [future roadmap item](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/release-notes/features-timeline), so do not document those PRs as available without rechecking the roadmap and feature documentation.

For routine version updates, Renovate is the primary documented candidate to evaluate because Renovate documents [Azure DevOps platform support](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/platform/azure/). Keep that separate from Azure Pipelines file-update support: the Renovate [Azure Pipelines manager](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/azure-pipelines/) is opt-in and disabled by default in current Renovate docs. Recheck that manager page for its current stability label before enabling it, because historical guidance has changed over time. If maintainers choose Renovate, decide the bot identity, permissions, schedules, repositories, and secret storage before enabling it.

Self-hosted Dependabot on Azure Pipelines is only an optional pattern to evaluate when maintainers intentionally choose it. Scope any adoption to the source being followed, review the required Azure DevOps permissions, and store tokens or credentials only in the service's secret-management mechanism.

Record the selected Azure DevOps security product and dependency update policy in the Azure DevOps Services adoption guidance path `.azuredevops/platform/adoption-guidance.md` during materialization. Keep durable template-wide guidance in the Azure DevOps Services support guide when an Azure host module is retained.

## Pre-commit Configuration

**File:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

### Python Runtime Without Python Project Source

Removing Python source files does not automatically remove Python from the repository's development tooling. The template uses Python to run `pre-commit`, `check-jsonschema`, `check-metaschema`, and repo-local hooks such as the Terraform wrappers.

If your downstream repository excludes the `python` module through the template sync procedure, the `python-only` inline block in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` removes the Python project hooks (`black` and `ruff-check`) while the baseline `.github/workflows/precommit-ci.yml` workflow continues to run the aggregate `pre-commit run --all-files` gate. Keep Python available on developer machines and CI runners that execute pre-commit itself, even when the repository contains no Python project source.

If you remove Python project files manually instead of using template sync, remove the complete `python-only` inline block from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Keep `.github/workflows/precommit-ci.yml` unless you are also removing pre-commit or replacing it with an equivalent aggregate CI gate.

### Adjusting Line Length

The default line length is 100 characters for both Black and Ruff. In `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, these entries live inside the `python-only` template-sync inline block so the template-sync framework can strip them automatically when the `python` module is excluded — the snippet below preserves those marker lines:

```yaml
# template-sync: begin python-only
- repo: https://github.com/psf/black
  rev: 26.3.1
  hooks:
    - id: black
      args: [--line-length=100]

- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  rev: v0.15.12
  hooks:
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [--fix, --line-length=100]
# template-sync: end python-only
```

**To use Black's default (88 characters):**

```yaml
args: [--line-length=88]
```

> **Note:** Ensure both Black and Ruff use the same line length to avoid conflicts.

### Adding Hooks for Other Languages

**Prettier (JavaScript/TypeScript/CSS):**

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
  rev: v3.1.0
  hooks:
    - id: prettier
      types_or: [javascript, jsx, ts, tsx, css, markdown]
```

> **JSON/JSONC and YAML are intentionally omitted from `types_or` above.** For JSON/JSONC, see [Prettier for JSON/JSONC (Opt-in)](#prettier-for-jsonjsonc-opt-in), which recommends a `repo: local` hook over `pre-commit/mirrors-prettier` to avoid pinning the Prettier version in two places. Prettier for YAML is discouraged by default in this template; see the YAML subsection of that same section for the reconciliation requirements if a project chooses to adopt it anyway.

**ESLint:**

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint
  rev: v8.56.0
  hooks:
    - id: eslint
      files: \.[jt]sx?$
      additional_dependencies:
        - eslint@8.56.0
        - eslint-config-your-config
```

**ShellCheck (Bash/Shell scripts):**

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/shellcheck-py/shellcheck-py
  rev: v0.9.0.6
  hooks:
    - id: shellcheck
```

### Switching to Husky

If your project prefers Husky for git hooks:

1. Remove `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
2. Install Husky:

   ```bash
   npm install husky --save-dev
   ```

3. Add the prepare script to `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "prepare": "husky"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Create `.husky/pre-commit`:

   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env sh
   . "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

   npm run lint
   npm test
   ```

> **Warning:** Pre-commit and Husky both manage `.git/hooks/pre-commit`. Do NOT run `pre-commit install` if using Husky, as the two tools conflict.

---

## Schema Validation Configuration

**Files:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `schemas/`, project test directory (for example, `tests/`)

This template ships `schemas/` with one clearly removable worked example and production schemas for template sync metadata (see [`schemas/README.md`](schemas/README.md)). **The default-enabled `check-jsonschema` configuration covers the worked example, `.template-sync/manifest.yml`, and `.template-sync/marker.yml` when present. When the GitHub platform module is retained, it also validates one real load-bearing repository file: `.github/dependabot.yml` against the bundled `vendor.dependabot` schema.** Beyond that, schema validation is opt-in and SHOULD be added per real schema-backed file family. If your downstream project does not need the worked example, follow the canonical [downstream removal checklist](schemas/README.md#downstream-removal-checklist) in `schemas/README.md` to remove it. Downstream repositories that use `.template-sync/marker.yml` SHOULD keep the marker schema hook so marker changes fail before review when they violate the contract.

### When to Add `check-jsonschema`

Add a [`check-jsonschema`](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema) hook when you have:

1. A real schema under `schemas/` (for example, `schemas/project-config.schema.json`), and
2. A real, identifiable file family that the schema validates (for example, every `config/*.json` in your project).

Do **not** add `check-jsonschema` hooks for schemas that do not yet exist, and do not configure a generic "validate every JSON/YAML file" hook. Pre-commit already runs `check-json` and `check-yaml` for syntax; `check-jsonschema` is for contract validation against a specific schema.

### Adding a Hook for One File Family

Add one hook per `(schema, file family)` pair to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema
  rev: 0.33.3
  hooks:
    - id: check-jsonschema
      name: Validate project JSON config
      files: ^config/.*\.json$
      args:
        - --schemafile
        - schemas/project-config.schema.json
```

> **Version pinning.** Implementers MUST verify and pin a current upstream version of `check-jsonschema` when enabling the hook, rather than copying the example `rev:` value above. Look up the latest tagged release at the upstream repository before adoption and update the pin via your normal dependency-update process (for example, Dependabot's `pre-commit` ecosystem).

If you have multiple schema-backed file families, add one hook **per family**, each scoped with its own `files:` pattern. Do not combine unrelated families into a single hook.

### Testing Valid Examples

Sample data files that should validate cleanly can be placed in either of two locations, with different validation consequences:

- **Inside the file family path covered by the family hook** (for example, `config/example.valid.json` for the hook above). The family hook will validate these automatically because they match its `files:` pattern.
- **Under `schemas/examples/<schema-name>/{valid,invalid}/`** (for example, `schemas/examples/project-config/valid/minimal.json`). This `schemas/examples/<schema-name>/{valid,invalid}/` layout is the convention used by `schemas/README.md` and the pytest tests referenced below, but it does **not** match the family hook's `files:` pattern, so these examples need a separate validation path. Choose one of:

  - Add a dedicated `check-jsonschema` hook scoped to **valid** fixtures under `schemas/examples/` only (for example, `files: ^schemas/examples/project-config/valid/.*\.json$`). Anchor the pattern under the `valid/` directory so the hook does not pick up `invalid/` fixtures (which MUST NOT be wired into a normal `check-jsonschema` hook — see the next subsection). This aligns with the `schemas/examples/<schema-name>/{valid,invalid}/` layout used in `schemas/README.md` § Examples and exercised by both [`tests/test_schema_examples.py`](tests/test_schema_examples.py) and [`templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py`](templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py).
  - Run `check-jsonschema` directly from a CI step or local script:

    ```bash
    check-jsonschema \
      --schemafile schemas/project-config.schema.json \
      schemas/examples/project-config/valid/minimal.json
    ```

  - Wire the example into the opt-in pytest template described under [Testing Invalid Examples](#testing-invalid-examples) (it exercises both valid and invalid cases).

Whichever placement you choose, valid examples MUST exit with code `0`; a non-zero exit indicates a broken example or a schema regression and MUST be fixed before merging.

### Testing Invalid Examples

Invalid examples (intentionally malformed fixtures used to prove that the schema rejects bad input) MUST NOT be wired into a normal `check-jsonschema` pre-commit hook, because the validator's non-zero exit would be reported as a hook failure on every run. Instead, write a test or script that **asserts validation fails**.

A starter pytest template lives at [`templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py`](templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py); the active, canonical version that this repository runs in CI lives at [`tests/test_schema_examples.py`](tests/test_schema_examples.py). Both auto-discover `(schema, example, expected_to_pass)` triples from `schemas/*.schema.json` and `schemas/examples/<schema-name>/{valid,invalid}/`. To use the starter:

1. Copy the file into your project's real `tests/` directory.
2. Place schemas under `schemas/<name>.schema.json` and examples under `schemas/examples/<name>/{valid,invalid}/`. Discovery is automatic — no per-case configuration is required.
3. Choose how to make `check-jsonschema` available to the test environment (see below).

### Making `check-jsonschema` Available to Tests

The active root test [`tests/test_schema_examples.py`](tests/test_schema_examples.py) requires `check-jsonschema`, which is declared in the root `pyproject.toml` `dev` dependency group and installed by `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` via `pip install -e ".[dev]"`. The starter under `templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py` retains a `skipif` guard so that downstream projects can copy it before adding the dependency. If you want the starter to run unconditionally in your repository, do one of the following:

- **Add it as a dev/test dependency.** For example, in `pyproject.toml`:

  ```toml
  [project.optional-dependencies]
  dev = [
      "pytest",
      "check-jsonschema",
  ]
  ```

  Then install with `pip install -e ".[dev]"` (or your preferred dev-install command) so `check-jsonschema` is on `PATH` for tests.

- **Install it in CI only.** Add an explicit install step (for example, `pip install check-jsonschema`) in the relevant CI workflow before the test step. Local developers without the tool installed will see the test skip rather than fail.

If you remove the `skipif` guard, you MUST ensure `check-jsonschema` is installed in every environment where the test runs; otherwise the test will fail with a `FileNotFoundError`-style error rather than a clear "tool missing" message.

### Defaults Recap

- The template ships the worked-example `check-jsonschema` configuration by default, plus the `vendor.dependabot` built-in schema hook when the GitHub platform module is retained:
  1. The worked-example schema (`schemas/example-config.schema.json`) and its valid example data files. A companion `check-metaschema` hook self-validates the schema against its declared JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 metaschema.
  2. When the GitHub platform module is retained, a `check-jsonschema --builtin-schema vendor.dependabot` hook that validates `.github/dependabot.yml` against the Dependabot built-in schema bundled with `check-jsonschema`. See the [Built-in Schema Validation for Real Load-Bearing Configuration Files](.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#design-decision-built-in-schema-validation-for-real-load-bearing-configuration-files) ADR for the policy, the explicit "Evaluated but deferred" negative-space record, and the downstream removal guidance.

  Downstream repositories MAY add additional `check-jsonschema` hook entries (project-owned `--schemafile` hooks for their own schema-backed file families, or additional `--builtin-schema` hooks for tool-owned configuration files), and MAY remove the worked example via the canonical [downstream removal checklist](schemas/README.md#downstream-removal-checklist). Hooks for files that a downstream repository deletes **MUST** be removed alongside the file.
- The template ships active root tests that depend on `check-jsonschema` (declared in the root `pyproject.toml` `dev` group): [`tests/test_schema_examples.py`](tests/test_schema_examples.py) validates schema examples; when the GitHub platform module is retained, [`tests/test_dependabot_schema.py`](tests/test_dependabot_schema.py) validates the documented Dependabot auto-assignment fixture against `vendor.dependabot`. A starter version of the schema-example pattern is provided at `templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py` for downstream adoption.
- Beyond the worked example and any wired built-in schema hooks, schema validation is opt-in; downstream repositories add real hooks and tests when they introduce additional real schemas, or when they want to enable additional `--builtin-schema` coverage.
- Project-owned schemas SHOULD continue to live under `schemas/`. Built-in schemas referenced via `--builtin-schema` are **not** vendored into `schemas/`; their content tracks `check-jsonschema` releases.
- JSONC, JSON5, ecosystem-specific YAML validators, and broader SchemaStore / catalog coverage remain opt-in unless a downstream repository explicitly ships them. See the dedicated subsections below for adoption guidance.

---

## JSON/YAML Starter Content (Opt-in)

**Files:** `templates/json/`, `templates/yaml/`, `schemas/`, `.yamllint.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

This template ships starter content under `templates/json/` and `templates/yaml/` that downstream consumers MAY copy and adapt to add schema-backed JSON contracts and YAML linting to their own repositories. The starter content is intentionally outside the active hook and test scopes:

- The active `Validate example-config valid examples` `check-jsonschema` hook in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) is anchored to `^schemas/examples/example-config/valid/.*\.json$`.
- The active `check-metaschema` hook is anchored to `^schemas/example-config\.schema\.json$`.
- The active root test [`tests/test_schema_examples.py`](tests/test_schema_examples.py) discovers schemas only under `schemas/`, not under `templates/**`.

**Do not broaden these scopes to cover `templates/**`.** The starter content is meant to be lifted into a downstream repository's `schemas/` and `.yamllint.yml`, not exercised as an active schema contract or active linting configuration in place. The starter files are still parsed by the repository's `check-json`, `check-yaml`, and `yamllint` pre-commit hooks like every other JSON/YAML file in the tree; the carve-out is specifically about schema validation (`check-jsonschema`/`check-metaschema`), the schema-example pytest contract, and "active configuration" roles, not about basic JSON/YAML parsing or style enforcement.

The two starter directories are described in detail in their own READMEs:

- [`templates/json/README.md`](templates/json/README.md)
- [`templates/yaml/README.md`](templates/yaml/README.md)

### Adopting the JSON Starter Schema and Examples

`templates/json/` ships:

- `templates/json/starter.schema.json` — minimal JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 starter with `$schema`, `$id`, `title`, `description`, `type: "object"`, `additionalProperties: false`, `required`, and `properties`.
- `templates/json/examples/starter/valid/minimal.json` — smallest valid instance.
- `templates/json/examples/starter/invalid/missing-required.json` — smallest invalid instance (omits a required property; rejected by the starter schema).

To adopt the starter schema in a downstream repository:

1. Copy `templates/json/starter.schema.json` to `schemas/<your-name>.schema.json` and rename it to match your file family (for example, `schemas/feature-flags.schema.json`).
2. Update `$id`, `title`, `description`, `properties`, `required`, and `additionalProperties` to reflect the real shape of your file family.
3. Copy `templates/json/examples/starter/valid/` to `schemas/examples/<your-name>/valid/` and `templates/json/examples/starter/invalid/` to `schemas/examples/<your-name>/invalid/`.
4. Add a scoped `check-jsonschema` pre-commit hook for the copied schema, following the pattern in [Schema Validation Configuration](#schema-validation-configuration). Anchor the hook's `files:` regex to the **valid** fixtures under the copied path (for example, `^schemas/examples/<your-name>/valid/.*\.json$`); do **not** wire invalid fixtures into a normal `check-jsonschema` hook.
5. Optionally, copy [`templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py`](templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py) into your project's `tests/` directory so that invalid fixtures are exercised by a test that asserts validation fails.

### Adopting the YAML Starter Configurations

`templates/yaml/` ships:

- `templates/yaml/yamllint.lenient.yml` — mirrors the active repository-root `.yamllint.yml` rule settings (`truthy.check-keys: false`, `comments-indentation: disable`, `line-length.level: warning`). The `rules:` block is byte-identical to the active root configuration; only the leading comment block differs (it documents the file's role as starter content rather than the active config).
- `templates/yaml/yamllint.strict.yml` — stricter alternative with `truthy.check-keys: true` and `line-length` at default error severity. Documented by the **yamllint truthy.check-keys Default** and **yamllint line-length Warning Level Default** ADRs in [`.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md). Adopting the strict variant requires quoting `"on":` in every GitHub Actions workflow file under `.github/workflows/*.yml`.
- `templates/yaml/starter-config.yaml` — minimal human-authored YAML config example demonstrating 2-space indentation, lowercase booleans, quoted version pins, quoted YAML 1.1 truthy-looking strings, and a short block scalar.

To adopt one of the yamllint configurations in a downstream repository, copy it to the repository root (overwriting any existing file):

```bash
# Use the template defaults verbatim:
cp templates/yaml/yamllint.lenient.yml .yamllint.yml

# Or adopt the stricter alternative (quote "on": in workflow files first):
cp templates/yaml/yamllint.strict.yml .yamllint.yml
```

If the downstream repository does not already have a `yamllint` pre-commit hook wired up, add one to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. The hook example from `templates/yaml/README.md`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint
  rev: v1.38.0
  hooks:
    - id: yamllint
      args: [-c, .yamllint.yml]
```

> **Version pinning.** Pin a current upstream release of [`yamllint`](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) rather than copying the example `rev:` value above. Update the pin via your normal dependency-update process.

### Adding a Scoped `check-jsonschema` Hook for Schema-Backed YAML

If a downstream repository has a schema-backed YAML file family (for example, an application configuration file with a published JSON Schema), add a scoped `check-jsonschema` hook for that family. This snippet is **optional** and is intended only when there is a concrete schema-backed YAML file family to validate; do not adopt it speculatively.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema
  rev: 0.33.3
  hooks:
    - id: check-jsonschema
      name: Validate <your-name> YAML config
      files: ^config/.*\.ya?ml$
      args:
        - --schemafile
        - schemas/<your-name>.schema.json
```

> **Version pinning.** Pin a current upstream release of [`check-jsonschema`](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema) rather than copying the example `rev:` value above.

### Cross-References to Other Optional Sections

- **Prettier for JSON/JSONC.** Prettier remains **opt-in** for JSON and JSONC; see [Prettier for JSON/JSONC (Opt-in)](#prettier-for-jsonjsonc-opt-in) for the adoption criteria and the important caveat that Prettier does not sort JSON keys.
- **Prettier for YAML.** Prettier for YAML is **discouraged by default** in this template unless the downstream repository explicitly reconciles Prettier's output with `yamllint` rules. See the YAML subsection of [Prettier for JSON/JSONC (Opt-in)](#prettier-for-jsonjsonc-opt-in).
- **Ecosystem-specific YAML validators.** Validators such as `kubeconform`, `spectral`, `cfn-lint`, `ansible-lint`, and `helm lint` remain **opt-in** and SHOULD be adopted only when the downstream repository actually contains the relevant ecosystem. See [Ecosystem-Specific YAML Validators (Opt-in)](#ecosystem-specific-yaml-validators-opt-in).
- **JSONC validation.** `.jsonc` files are deliberately not covered by `check-json`; see [JSONC Validation (Opt-in)](#jsonc-validation-opt-in) for the recommended JSONC-aware tooling options.

### Verifying the Starter Files Locally

You can verify the starter JSON content directly with `check-jsonschema` from the command line at any time without pre-commit:

```bash
# Should exit 0 (valid against the starter schema):
check-jsonschema \
  --schemafile templates/json/starter.schema.json \
  templates/json/examples/starter/valid/minimal.json

# Should exit non-zero (invalid against the starter schema):
check-jsonschema \
  --schemafile templates/json/starter.schema.json \
  templates/json/examples/starter/invalid/missing-required.json

# Self-validate the starter schema against its declared metaschema:
check-jsonschema --check-metaschema templates/json/starter.schema.json
```

Run these checks against the **copied** schema and fixtures in your downstream repository (with paths updated accordingly) before wiring the new schema into pre-commit.

---

## Prettier for JSON/JSONC (Opt-in)

**Files:** `package.json`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is **not** part of the default JSON/YAML toolchain in this template. Prettier MAY be adopted on a per-repository basis to enforce JSON and JSONC formatting beyond what `check-json` validates. **No Prettier configuration, dependency, or hook is added to the repo root by default.** Adoption is an explicit project decision.

> **Background.** The default pre-commit stack uses `check-json` (strict `.json` syntax only), `check-yaml`, `yamllint`, and `actionlint`. See [Schema Validation Configuration](#schema-validation-configuration) for the schema-validation path, and the [Prettier deferral ADR in `.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#design-decision-prettier-deferral-for-data-files) for the rationale behind keeping Prettier opt-in.

### When to Adopt Prettier for JSON/JSONC

Adopt Prettier for JSON/JSONC when **at least one** of the following is true:

- The project already uses Node tooling for other purposes (for example, `markdownlint-cli2`, JavaScript/TypeScript builds), so adding Prettier does not introduce a new ecosystem.
- The team wants editor format-on-save consistency across contributors.
- Many JSON/JSONC files in the project benefit from formatter enforcement (consistent indentation, trailing newline, key spacing) that `check-json` does not provide.
- The project has many `.jsonc` files and wants formatting enforcement, since `check-json` does not validate `.jsonc`. Prettier is **one option among several pieces of JSONC-aware tooling** that can fill this gap (other options include dedicated JSONC parsers and schema validators that understand JSONC).

### When Not to Adopt Prettier for JSON/JSONC

Do **not** adopt Prettier when:

- Adding Node tooling would create friction (for example, the project is otherwise pure Python, PowerShell, or Terraform with no existing Node dependency).
- `check-json` syntax validation alone is sufficient for the project's JSON files.
- The project does not want formatter-controlled diffs on data files (Prettier rewrites files in-place; downstream consumers MUST be comfortable with formatter-driven churn).

### Important Caveat: Prettier Does Not Sort JSON Keys

Prettier formats JSON whitespace, indentation, and line endings, but it **does not** sort object keys. Stable key ordering — often the highest-value JSON-stability property — must still be enforced by hand or by a separate tool. Adopters who care about deterministic key order MUST treat Prettier as a formatting tool only and add a separate key-ordering process if needed.

### Recommended `package.json` Scripts

If Prettier is adopted, add `format:json` and `lint:json:format` scripts to `package.json` so that contributors and CI use the same commands:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format:json": "prettier --write \"**/*.{json,jsonc}\" \"!node_modules/**\"",
    "lint:json:format": "prettier --check \"**/*.{json,jsonc}\" \"!node_modules/**\""
  }
}
```

The `--check` variant is suitable for CI; the `--write` variant rewrites files in place locally.

### Recommended `.prettierrc.json`

A minimal Prettier configuration that aligns with the template's other formatting defaults (LF line endings, 2-space indent):

```json
{
  "printWidth": 120,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "endOfLine": "lf",
  "trailingComma": "none"
}
```

`trailingComma: "none"` is required for strict `.json`; for `.jsonc` consumers that accept trailing commas, this setting is still safe (Prettier will simply omit them).

### Recommended `.prettierignore`

Add a `.prettierignore` file that excludes generated files, dependencies, and any directories that should not be reformatted. A typical baseline:

```text
node_modules/
package-lock.json
dist/
build/
coverage/
.venv/
```

Adopters SHOULD review their repository for additional generated or vendored content (for example, lockfiles, cached schema bundles, fixtures whose formatting is asserted by tests) and add those paths as well.

### Optional Local Pre-commit Hook

If the project already runs Prettier from `package.json` scripts, a `repo: local` pre-commit hook keeps the version under project control rather than pinning a separate Prettier mirror:

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: prettier-json-check
      name: Check JSON and JSONC formatting with Prettier
      entry: npx --no-install prettier --check "**/*.{json,jsonc}" "!node_modules/**"
      language: system
      files: '\.(json|jsonc)$'
      pass_filenames: false
```

The `files:` regex scopes the hook so pre-commit only invokes it on commits that touch `.json` or `.jsonc` files; without that filter, `pass_filenames: false` would cause the hook to run (and re-scan the repo's JSON/JSONC globs) on every commit. `pass_filenames: false` lets the glob in `entry:` decide which files Prettier inspects, which keeps the hook consistent with the `lint:json:format` script. The `--no-install` flag tells `npx` to fail rather than fetch an unpinned Prettier on demand, so the hook always uses the version recorded in `package.json` / `package-lock.json`.

> **Node availability requirement.** Because this hook shells out to `npx`, every environment that runs `pre-commit` MUST have Node.js installed and the project's npm dependencies installed (typically via `npm ci`). The template's default CI workflows do not install Node, so adopters who add this hook MUST also add a Node setup step (for example, `actions/setup-node` followed by `npm ci`) to any workflow that runs `pre-commit run --all-files`, and ensure the same is true on contributor workstations.

<!-- -->

> **`pre-commit/mirrors-prettier` is not the recommended path.** The `pre-commit/mirrors-prettier` repository pins a Prettier version separately from the project's `package.json`, which creates two sources of truth for the Prettier version. Prefer the `repo: local` hook above so that `package.json`, CI scripts, and the pre-commit hook all use the same Prettier version.

### YAML

Prettier for YAML is **discouraged by default** in this template. Prettier's YAML output diverges from idiomatic `yamllint` defaults (line wrapping, flow vs. block style, quoting), and running both without explicit reconciliation produces churn-only diffs.

If a project chooses to adopt Prettier for YAML anyway, it MUST reconcile `yamllint` and Prettier so they do not fight. At minimum:

- Pin both tools.
- Adjust `.yamllint.yml` rules (for example, `line-length`, `quoted-strings`, `indentation`) to match Prettier's output, or configure Prettier to match `.yamllint.yml`.
- Run both tools on a representative sample and confirm a clean pass before enabling either in CI.

### Docker Alternative

Projects that do not want a local Node.js installation MAY run Prettier from a Docker image in CI (for example, the official `node:` images or community-maintained Prettier images). The `package.json` scripts and the `.prettierrc.json` configuration above remain unchanged; only the invocation differs. Local developers can still use `npx prettier` if they have Node available, or rely on CI to enforce formatting.

### Editor Formatter Guidance

The template's `.vscode/settings.json` only prescribes the PowerShell file encoding (see [VS Code PowerShell File Encoding for Non-ASCII Characters](#vs-code-powershell-file-encoding-for-non-ascii-characters)) and does **not** prescribe editor formatters for any language. Editor-formatter guidance for JSON, JSONC, and YAML is therefore intentionally omitted here; downstream consumers who adopt Prettier MAY add `[json]`, `[jsonc]`, and `[yaml]` formatter sections to their own `.vscode/settings.json` at their discretion.

---

## JSONC Validation (Opt-in)

**Files:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, JSONC-aware tooling of your choice

The default `check-json` pre-commit hook is anchored with `files: \.json$`, so it deliberately does **not** validate `.jsonc` files. JSONC (JSON with comments) is a superset that strict JSON parsers reject, so `check-json` would mis-flag every JSONC file with comments or trailing commas as a syntax error.

**Recommendation:** Repositories with load-bearing JSONC files (for example, configuration that downstream tools read with a JSONC-aware parser) SHOULD adopt **JSONC-aware tooling** rather than retrofitting `check-json` to accept JSONC. Candidate approaches include:

- A JSONC-aware parser invoked from a `repo: local` pre-commit hook (for example, a small Python or Node.js script that uses a JSONC parser library).
- A JSONC-aware schema validator if the JSONC files are also schema-backed.
- Prettier with a JSONC parser (see [Prettier for JSON/JSONC (Opt-in)](#prettier-for-jsonjsonc-opt-in)) for formatting only — Prettier does not enforce strict syntax in the same way `check-json` does.

**Why the default `check-json` regex is anchored.** The anchored regex is intentional and reflects an explicit design decision: `.json` and `.jsonc` are different dialects with different parsers, and validating both with the same strict-JSON tool would produce false positives on every JSONC comment or trailing comma. Retrofitting `check-json` is therefore **not** the recommended path; add separate JSONC-aware tooling instead.

---

## JSON5 Support (Opt-in)

**Files:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, JSON5-aware tooling of your choice

JSON5 is **not** enabled by default in this template. The JSON authoring guide ([`.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/json.instructions.md)) intentionally omits `.json5`, and no pre-commit hook validates JSON5 syntax out of the box.

**Recommendation:** Adopting JSON5 SHOULD be an explicit, documented project decision rather than an implicit drift from JSON. If a downstream project adopts JSON5:

- Document the decision (which directories, which consumers, why JSON5 over strict JSON or JSONC).
- Add a JSON5-aware parser or validator (for example, a `repo: local` hook that uses a JSON5 parser library).
- Confirm that all consumers of the JSON5 files actually support JSON5 syntax — many tools that accept "loose JSON" only accept JSONC, not full JSON5.

See the [JSON5 exclusion ADR in `.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#design-decision-json5-exclusion-by-default) for the rationale behind keeping JSON5 out of the default toolchain.

---

## Ecosystem-Specific YAML Validators (Opt-in)

**Files:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, ecosystem-specific configuration files

The default YAML toolchain (`check-yaml`, `yamllint`, `actionlint`) covers syntax, style, and GitHub Actions workflow correctness. Ecosystem-specific validators add semantic checks for particular YAML dialects and SHOULD be adopted **only when the repository actually uses those ecosystems** — adding a validator for a stack the project does not use creates noise without enforcing anything useful.

| Ecosystem | Recommended Validator | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kubernetes manifests | [`kubeconform`](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform) (or equivalent, e.g. `kubeval`, `kubectl --dry-run`) | Validates manifest schemas against the relevant Kubernetes API version. |
| OpenAPI / AsyncAPI | [`spectral`](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral) | Lints API contracts against built-in or custom rulesets. |
| AWS CloudFormation | [`cfn-lint`](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint) | Validates CloudFormation templates against AWS resource specifications. |
| Ansible playbooks/roles | [`ansible-lint`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) | Enforces Ansible best practices and detects common errors. |
| Helm charts | [`helm lint`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_lint/) (and optionally `kubeconform` post-render) | Validates chart structure and renders templates for further validation. |

Adopters MAY add these as additional pre-commit hooks (or as separate CI jobs) when their repository contains the relevant file types. Do **not** add them speculatively.

---

## Future SchemaStore Validation for Repository Configuration Files

**Status:** Mixed — when the GitHub platform module is retained, `.github/dependabot.yml` is validated by default (see [Schema Validation Configuration](#schema-validation-configuration) and the [Built-in Schema Validation for Real Load-Bearing Configuration Files ADR](.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#design-decision-built-in-schema-validation-for-real-load-bearing-configuration-files)). Other candidates remain future work and are not enabled by default.

Several common repository configuration files have public schemas published on [SchemaStore](https://www.schemastore.org/) or maintained by their respective ecosystems. Wiring schema validation for any of the **deferred** candidates below is out of scope for the worked example shipped under `schemas/` and requires an explicit downstream project decision.

Candidate files (cross-referenced from the [Future Work section in `schemas/README.md`](schemas/README.md#future-work) and the [Built-in Schema Validation for Real Load-Bearing Configuration Files ADR](.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#design-decision-built-in-schema-validation-for-real-load-bearing-configuration-files)):

- **`package.json`** — schema available on SchemaStore. A downstream project MAY add a `check-jsonschema` hook scoped to `^package\.json$` that points at the SchemaStore-published schema (for example, via `check-jsonschema`'s built-in `vendor.package-json` schema selector if available). Useful when `package.json` carries non-trivial metadata that should be validated beyond basic JSON syntax.
- **Generated package-manager lockfiles** (for example, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock` in JSON form, `composer.lock`) — schema validation MAY be useful, but only if it does **not** conflict with the package manager's own validation. Most package managers already validate their lockfiles internally; an additional schema check is justified only when a stable schema-backed validation path adds value the package manager does not already provide.
- **GitHub Actions workflow files** — already covered by `actionlint`. An additional `check-jsonschema` hook against the SchemaStore Actions schema would be **redundant** with `actionlint` and is **not recommended**. See the "Evaluated but deferred" subsection of the [Built-in Schema Validation ADR](.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#design-decision-built-in-schema-validation-for-real-load-bearing-configuration-files) for the durable rationale.

For all of the above, follow the schema-validation guidance in [Schema Validation Configuration](#schema-validation-configuration): add **one `check-jsonschema` hook per real schema-backed file family**, scoped to the files that family covers, and keep the default toolchain free of placeholder hooks. See the [Future Work section in `schemas/README.md`](schemas/README.md#future-work) for additional context and avoid restating that future-work note here.

## Removing the Worked Example Schema

**Files:** `schemas/`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `tests/test_schema_examples.py`, `.github/workflows/data-ci.yml`, related documentation

The template ships a worked-example schema (`schemas/example-config.schema.json`), valid and invalid example fixtures under `schemas/examples/example-config/`, two pre-commit hooks (`check-jsonschema` for valid examples, `check-metaschema` for the schema itself), and the schema-example pytest contract at [`tests/test_schema_examples.py`](tests/test_schema_examples.py). The worked example is intentionally easy to remove for downstream repositories that do not use schema-backed validation.

**To remove the worked example, follow the canonical [Downstream Removal Checklist](schemas/README.md#downstream-removal-checklist) in `schemas/README.md`.** That checklist is the single source of truth for the exact files, hooks, and references to remove; do not improvise the steps from memory and do not duplicate the checklist here.

---

## Markdown Linting Configuration

**File:** `.markdownlint.jsonc`

### Customizing Style Rules

The following rules can be configured to match your project's documentation style:

| Rule | Description | Default | Options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MD003 | Heading style | `atx` | `atx`, `setext`, `consistent` |
| MD004 | Unordered list marker | `dash` | `dash`, `asterisk`, `plus`, `consistent` |
| MD012 | Maximum consecutive blank lines | `2` | Any positive integer |
| MD024 | Multiple headings with same content | `siblings_only: true` | `true`, `false`, or object with `siblings_only` |
| MD029 | Ordered list prefix | `ordered` | `ordered`, `one`, `one_or_ordered` |
| MD035 | Horizontal rule style | `---` | `---`, `***`, `___`, `consistent` |
| MD048 | Code fence style | `backtick` | `backtick`, `tilde`, `consistent` |
| MD049 | Emphasis style | `asterisk` | `asterisk`, `underscore`, `consistent` |
| MD050 | Strong style | `asterisk` | `asterisk`, `underscore`, `consistent` |

**Example: Using asterisks for unordered lists:**

```jsonc
{
  "MD004": {
    "style": "asterisk"
  }
}
```

**Example: Allowing up to 3 consecutive blank lines:**

```jsonc
{
  "MD012": {
    "maximum": 3
  }
}
```

**Example: Disallowing duplicate headings entirely:**

```jsonc
{
  "MD024": {
    "siblings_only": false
  }
}
```

### Re-enabling Disabled Rules

Several rules are disabled by default because they are not auto-fixable:

| Rule | Why Disabled | When to Enable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MD013 | Line length not auto-fixable | If you want to enforce line length limits |
| MD034 | Bare URLs may be intentional | If you want all URLs to use link syntax |
| MD036 | False positives with bold text | If you want to prevent emphasis as headings |
| MD041 | Prevents badges/metadata at start | If you require first line to be a heading |

**To re-enable a rule:**

```jsonc
{
  "MD013": {
    "line_length": 120
  },
  "MD041": true
}
```

### Using the cli2-Specific Configuration Format

The repository includes an alternative configuration template at `templates/markdown/.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` that uses the `markdownlint-cli2` specific format where rules are nested under a `"config"` key.

#### When to Use Each Format

| File | Format | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.markdownlint.jsonc` | Standard (rules at root) | Default choice; works with both `markdownlint-cli` and `markdownlint-cli2` |
| `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` | cli2-specific (rules under `"config"`) | When you need cli2-specific features like `globs`, `ignores`, `customRules`, or `frontMatter` parser options |

Both files contain **identical linting rules**; only the structure differs.

#### Switching to the cli2-Specific Format

If you want to use the cli2-specific format, copy the template to your repository root and remove the original configuration file.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "templates/markdown/.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc" -Destination ".markdownlint-cli2.jsonc"
Remove-Item -Path ".markdownlint.jsonc" -Force
```

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

```bash
cp templates/markdown/.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc
rm .markdownlint.jsonc
```

> **Note:** When using `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, any rule customizations must be made inside the `"config"` block, not at the root level of the JSON.

**See also:** [markdownlint-cli2 documentation](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) for additional cli2-specific configuration options.

## Markdown Link Checking Configuration

**Files:** `.remarkrc.mjs`, `.remarkignore`, `package.json`

The repository uses `remark-cli` with `remark-validate-links` for offline Markdown link validation. This complements markdownlint: `npm run lint:md` enforces Markdown formatting, while `npm run lint:md:links` checks repository-local file links and Markdown heading fragments.

### How to Run

```bash
npm run lint:md:links
```

The default command is offline and deterministic. It validates local Markdown links, including cross-file relative links such as `[guide](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md)` and cross-file heading links such as `[section](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md#markdown-linting-configuration)`.

For this GitHub-hosted template repository, `remark-validate-links` uses its hosted-Git detection so normal GitHub-style Markdown heading fragments are validated. If a downstream repository uses a non-GitHub renderer or custom heading IDs, verify the checker behavior before treating the command as authoritative for that renderer.

### Scan Exclusions

The root `.remarkignore` file excludes generated, dependency, VCS, and runtime/cache directories such as `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.terraform/`, `dist/`, `build/`, and coverage output. Keep new exclusions narrow and tied to directories that are generated or not maintained as repository documentation.

The root `.remarkrc.mjs` file configures `remark-validate-links`. It includes one narrow skip for the literal placeholder target `...`, which appears in protected instruction guidance as PowerShell syntax rather than as a real repository link. Do not use broad skip patterns to hide normal broken links.

### External URL Policy

The default command does **not** validate external HTTP or HTTPS URLs. This avoids CI flakes caused by network outages, rate limits, redirects, or temporary upstream failures.

If your project needs external URL checking, add it as a separate opt-in command such as `lint:md:links:external`, configure explicit timeout and retry behavior, and avoid running that command in default CI until your team accepts the flakiness trade-off.

### Pre-commit Integration (Optional)

The template intentionally does not run the Markdown link checker in default pre-commit hooks. If your downstream repository wants local pre-commit enforcement, first ensure contributors have Node.js, npm, and installed project dependencies (`npm install` or `npm ci`), then add a local hook:

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: markdown-link-check
      name: Validate Markdown links
      entry: npm run lint:md:links
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false
      files: \.md$
```

This hook uses the same offline/local-link mode as CI. It does not enable external URL checking.

### When to Use This Feature

This feature is most useful for documentation-heavy repositories, template repositories with many cross-references, and projects that frequently rename or move Markdown files.

### Removing This Feature

If your project does not need Markdown link checking, remove the feature in one change so the package metadata, workflow, and documentation stay consistent:

1. Delete `.remarkrc.mjs` and `.remarkignore`.
2. Remove the `lint:md:links` script from `package.json`.
3. Remove the link-check step from `.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml`, and update the final lint-result condition so it no longer references `steps.lint-links`.
4. Remove the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm uninstall remark-cli remark-validate-links
   ```

5. Run `npm install` to update `package-lock.json`.
6. Remove any optional pre-commit hook you added for `markdown-link-check`.

## Nested Markdown Linting Configuration

**File:** `.github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js`

This optional script lints Markdown content embedded within code fences (` ```markdown ` or ` ```md `) in Markdown files. This is useful for documentation-heavy projects that include Markdown examples, ensuring that nested Markdown content follows the same linting rules as the outer Markdown files.

### How to Run

**Scan all Markdown files in the repository:**

```bash
npm run lint:md:nested
```

**Lint specific files:**

```bash
node .github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js file1.md file2.md
```

When file arguments are provided, only those files are linted (useful for pre-commit hooks). When no arguments are provided, all `.md` files are scanned via glob (excluding `node_modules` and `.pytest_cache`).

### Automatic Rule Adjustments

The script automatically disables two rules for nested Markdown content:

| Rule | Description | Why Disabled |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MD041 | First line in a file should be a top-level heading | Nested Markdown snippets may not start with a top-level heading |
| MD051 | Link fragments should be valid | Nested Markdown often contains example/placeholder links that reference anchors in other documents |

### Pre-commit Integration (Optional)

If you want to run this script as a pre-commit hook, you can add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: lint-nested-markdown
      name: Lint nested Markdown
      entry: node .github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js
      language: node
      files: \.md$
      pass_filenames: true
```

### When to Use This Feature

This feature is most useful for:

- **Documentation-heavy projects** with Markdown examples in code blocks
- **Template repositories** that include example Markdown snippets
- **Projects with contributing guides** that show Markdown formatting examples

### Removing This Feature

If you decide you don't need nested markdown linting, you can remove this optional feature to reduce your dependency footprint. The script and its dependencies are not required for the core functionality of this template.

> **Note:** Removing this feature is optional. The script doesn't cause any problems if left in place—it simply won't be used if you don't invoke it.

**Steps to remove:**

1. **Delete the script file:**

   **Windows (PowerShell):**

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Path ".github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js" -Force
   ```

   **macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

   ```bash
   rm .github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js
   ```

2. **Remove the npm script from `package.json`:**

   Open `package.json` and delete the `lint:md:nested` line from the `scripts` section. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "lint:md": "markdownlint-cli2 \"**/*.md\" \"#node_modules\" \"#.pytest_cache\"",
       "lint:md:nested": "node .github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js",  ← Delete this line
       ...
     }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** Keep all other scripts in the section; only remove the `lint:md:nested` line.

3. **Remove the npm dependencies only used by this script:**

   **Windows (PowerShell):**

   ```powershell
   npm uninstall glob jsonc-parser markdown-it
   ```

   **macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

   ```bash
   npm uninstall glob jsonc-parser markdown-it
   ```

4. **Update the lock file:**

   Run npm install to update `package-lock.json` to reflect the removed dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **If you added pre-commit integration, remove the hook:**

   Open `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and remove the `lint-nested-markdown` hook section:

   ```yaml
   # Remove this entire block if present:
   - repo: local
     hooks:
       - id: lint-nested-markdown
         name: Lint nested Markdown
         entry: node .github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js
         language: node
         files: \.md$
         pass_filenames: true
   ```

---

## Markdown Lint Workflow Configuration

**File:** `.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml`

The Markdown Lint workflow enforces consistent Markdown formatting, nested Markdown code-fence linting, and offline local-link validation on every push and pull request. While it works out-of-the-box, you can customize it to match your project's needs.

### Restricting Branch Triggers

The default configuration runs on all branches:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["**"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]
```

**To run only on the default branch:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
```

**To run on multiple specific branches:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main", "develop"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main", "develop"]
```

### Adding Path Filters

By default, the workflow runs on every push and pull request regardless of which files changed. To only run the workflow when Markdown files or linting/link-check configuration changes:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths:
      - '**/*.md'
      - '.markdownlint.jsonc'
      - '.remarkignore'
      - '.remarkrc.mjs'
      - 'package.json'
      - 'package-lock.json'
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths:
      - '**/*.md'
      - '.markdownlint.jsonc'
      - '.remarkignore'
      - '.remarkrc.mjs'
      - 'package.json'
      - 'package-lock.json'
```

> **Note:** Include configuration files in the path filter to ensure the workflow runs when linting or link-check rules change. For the default template, include `.markdownlint.jsonc`, `.remarkignore`, `.remarkrc.mjs`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json`.

### Changing Node.js Version

The workflow uses Node.js 24 by default:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v6
  with:
    node-version: '24'
```

**To use a different Node.js version:**

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v6
  with:
    node-version: '22'
```

> **Note:** Ensure the Node.js version you choose is compatible with your project's dependencies. Check the markdownlint-cli2 and remark documentation for supported Node.js versions.

### Disabling Nested Markdown Linting in CI

The workflow runs three validation steps: one for outer Markdown files, one for nested Markdown code fences, and one for offline Markdown link checking. If you want to keep the outer linting and link checking but disable the nested linting step in CI:

**Option 1: Remove the step entirely**

Delete or comment out the nested linting step:

```yaml
# Remove or comment out this step:
# - name: Run markdownlint on nested Markdown code fences
#   id: lint-nested
#   continue-on-error: true
#   run: npm run lint:md:nested
```

And update the final check step to check only the outer linting and link-check results:

```yaml
- name: Check linting results
  if: steps.lint-outer.outcome == 'failure' || steps.lint-links.outcome == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "::error::Markdown linting failed. Check the logs above for details."
    exit 1
```

**Option 2: Skip the step conditionally**

Add a condition to skip the nested linting step:

```yaml
- name: Run markdownlint on nested Markdown code fences
  id: lint-nested
  if: false  # Disabled - remove this line to re-enable
  continue-on-error: true
  run: npm run lint:md:nested
```

> **Note:** If you disable nested linting in CI, you may still want to run it locally using `npm run lint:md:nested` to catch issues before pushing.

### Disabling Markdown Link Checking in CI

If your repository does not need offline link checking in CI, remove or comment out the link-check step:

```yaml
# - name: Validate Markdown links
#   id: lint-links
#   continue-on-error: true
#   run: npm run lint:md:links
```

Then update the final check step so it no longer references `steps.lint-links`:

```yaml
- name: Check linting results
  if: steps.lint-outer.outcome == 'failure' || steps.lint-nested.outcome == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "::error::Markdown linting failed. Check the logs above for details."
    exit 1
```

### Removing the Workflow

If your project doesn't need Markdown linting in CI (for example, if you only use pre-commit hooks locally), you can remove the workflow file entirely.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path ".github/workflows/markdownlint.yml" -Force
```

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

```bash
rm -f .github/workflows/markdownlint.yml
```

> **Note:** Removing the CI workflow does not affect local linting. You can still run `npm run lint:md` locally or use pre-commit hooks to lint Markdown files before committing.

## Toolchain End-of-Life Monitoring

**Files:** `.github/workflows/toolchain-eol.yml`, `.github/scripts/check-toolchain-eol.js`, `tests/toolchain-eol/`

The optional Toolchain EOL workflow checks whether monitored Node.js release lines used by this repository are approaching or past end-of-life. It complements Dependabot: Dependabot updates dependency manifests and GitHub Actions `uses:` references, but it does not currently provide runtime-EOL monitoring for values such as `node-version`, Azure Pipelines Node task inputs, or `engines.node`.

The scanner uses the official Node.js release schedule JSON as its authoritative data source:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodejs/Release/main/schedule.json
```

The workflow is fail-only. It uses least-privilege `contents: read` permissions and fails the scheduled or manually triggered run when a monitored Node.js line is within the configured warning window or is already EOL. It does not open or update tracking issues.

### Monitored Selector Classes

The scanner inventories checked-in Node.js selectors from live CI and package configuration surfaces:

- `ci-runtime`: GitHub Actions `actions/setup-node` `node-version` and `node-version-file` inputs, GitHub Actions matrix-fed Node selectors, Azure Pipelines `UseNode@1` and `NodeTool@0` Node selectors, Azure checked-in parameter defaults and `values:`, Azure variables and `$(...)` macro references, Azure matrix values, and referenced repository version files such as `.nvmrc` or `.node-version`.
- `support-floor`: root `package.json` `engines.node`, plus `package-lock.json` `packages[""].engines.node` as the root-package mirror and consistency check.

The scanner intentionally ignores GitHub Actions wrapper versions such as `actions/setup-node@v6`; the runtime selector is the `node-version` or `node-version-file` input. It also ignores transitive `package-lock.json` package descriptors under `node_modules/**`, because those describe dependency constraints rather than this repository's support policy.

Documentation and example scanning is not implemented. Documentation snippets are therefore out of scope for required live-policy failures unless a downstream repository extends the scanner and declares those findings as monitored policy.

### Warning Window

The default warning window is 180 days before the Node.js line's EOL date. A line at or past EOL fails regardless of the warning-window value.

The default is configured in `.github/workflows/toolchain-eol.yml`:

```yaml
env:
  TOOLCHAIN_EOL_WARNING_DAYS: "180"
```

Maintainers can change the committed default by editing that environment value, or run a manual `workflow_dispatch` check with a different `warning-window-days` input while testing a runtime change.

### Schedule and Manual Runs

The workflow runs monthly through `schedule` and also supports `workflow_dispatch` for manual checks after runtime-selector changes.

GitHub scheduled workflows run on the repository default branch. Scheduled runs can be delayed or dropped during periods of high GitHub Actions load, and scheduled workflows in public repositories can be disabled after repository inactivity. Keep `workflow_dispatch` available so maintainers can run the check manually when those platform limitations matter.

### Local Test Command

Run the scanner's focused fixture tests with:

```bash
npm run test:toolchain-eol
```

Those tests use fixture Node.js release-schedule data and cover selector discovery, classification, support-floor range parsing, warning-window behavior, and package-lock transitive-engine exclusion.

### Removing or Replacing the Workflow

Downstream adopters that do not want optional runtime-EOL monitoring can remove these files and update `package.json` / `package-lock.json` if the scanner-only dependencies are no longer needed:

- `.github/workflows/toolchain-eol.yml`
- `.github/scripts/check-toolchain-eol.js`
- `tests/toolchain-eol/`
- the `test:toolchain-eol` npm script
- direct scanner parser dependencies that are otherwise unused, such as `semver` or `yaml`

Downstream adopters may replace this scanner with a maintained third-party EOL-check Action, or with a narrower `endoflife.date` API check for known pinned runtimes, if they accept the reduced selector-inventory precision. In this template, Node.js schedule data from the official Node.js release repository remains the authoritative source.

## Copilot Documentation Instructions Configuration

**File:** `.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md`

GitHub Copilot instruction files (`.github/instructions/*.md`) provide coding and documentation standards that Copilot applies when generating or editing code in your repository. The `docs.instructions.md` file specifically provides documentation standards that Copilot applies to all Markdown files, defining contract-first, traceable, and drift-resistant documentation practices.

The file contains several customization points that should be updated to match your project's specific needs.

### Customizing Documentation Taxonomy

The default taxonomy suggests a folder structure for documentation:

```markdown
- **Product spec:** `docs/spec/` (requirements + design; the source of truth)
- **Developer docs:** `docs/` (how to build, test, extend)
- **Operational docs / runbooks:** `docs/runbooks/` (diagnosis, remediation, safe operations)
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** `docs/adr/` (durable decisions)
```

**To customize for your project's structure:**

Update the taxonomy section to reflect your actual documentation organization. For example, if your project uses a different structure:

```markdown
- **API documentation:** `docs/api/` (API reference and usage guides)
- **User guides:** `docs/guides/` (end-user documentation)
- **Developer docs:** `docs/dev/` (how to build, test, extend)
- **Release notes:** `docs/releases/` (version history and changelogs)
```

> **Note:** If your project does not have a formal documentation structure, you can simplify this section to match your needs or remove categories that don't apply.

### Customizing Canonical Source of Truth

The file recommends defining a canonical specification document that serves as the authoritative reference for system behavior:

```markdown
Projects SHOULD define a canonical specification document (e.g., `docs/spec/requirements.md`)
that serves as the authoritative reference for system behavior and requirements.
```

**To customize for your project:**

- If you have a canonical spec, update the example path to match your actual location:

  ```markdown
  Projects SHOULD define a canonical specification document (e.g., `docs/SPEC.md`)
  that serves as the authoritative reference for system behavior and requirements.
  ```

- If your project does not use a formal specification document, you can note this explicitly or remove the section entirely.

### Customizing Requirements Documentation Standards

The file provides a pattern for tracking formal requirements with identifiers:

```markdown
- Each requirement SHOULD have a stable identifier (example pattern):
  - `PROJ-REQ-001`, `PROJ-REQ-002`, ...
```

**To customize for your project:**

1. **Update the requirement ID pattern** to match your project's naming convention:

   ```markdown
   - Each requirement SHOULD have a stable identifier (example pattern):
     - `MYPROJ-REQ-001`, `MYPROJ-REQ-002`, ...
   ```

2. **Adjust the requirement entry format** if your project uses different metadata fields. The default includes Rationale, Acceptance Criteria, Priority, and Verification. You might customize this to:

   ```markdown
   - Each requirement entry SHOULD include:
     - **Rationale:** why it exists
     - **Acceptance Criteria:** objective checks (bullets)
     - **Owner:** responsible team or individual
     - **Target Release:** version when this should be implemented
   ```

3. **If your project does not track formal requirements**, you can simplify or remove this section entirely. Consider replacing it with guidance appropriate for your documentation needs.

## Copilot Python Instructions Configuration

**File:** `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md`

The `python.instructions.md` file provides Python coding standards that GitHub Copilot applies when generating or editing `.py` files in your repository. These standards define style, structure, error handling, testing, and documentation requirements for Python code. The file supports two modes: **Baseline** (stdlib-first, portability-first) and **Modern-Advanced** (for projects using FastAPI, Pydantic, async frameworks, etc.).

Teams may want to customize these standards to match their project's specific requirements and preferences.

### Choosing Between Baseline and Modern-Advanced Mode

The file defines two distinct coding modes:

**Baseline Mode (Default):**

- Minimal dependencies (stdlib-first)
- Type hints are optional/opportunistic
- Explicit control flow; avoids metaprogramming
- Uses plain datatypes (`dict`, `list`, `tuple`) for simple tasks
- Prioritizes portability and clarity

**Modern-Advanced Mode:**

- Type hints required pervasively
- Uses `pathlib.Path` over `os.path`
- Supports async/await patterns
- Uses structured logging
- Suited for FastAPI, Pydantic, and type-heavy APIs

**To customize for your project:**

1. **For modern-only projects (FastAPI, Pydantic, async stacks):** Update the "Executive Summary: Author Profile" section to indicate that Modern-Advanced mode is the default. You may also simplify or remove Baseline-specific guidance from sections like "Baseline vs Modern-Advanced Mode" and the Quick Reference Checklist items tagged `[Baseline]`.

2. **For stdlib-first projects:** Keep Baseline mode as the default. Consider removing or de-emphasizing Modern-Advanced sections if your project never uses async frameworks or type-heavy APIs.

3. **For mixed projects:** Keep both modes documented but add project-specific guidance on when each applies (e.g., "Use Baseline mode for CLI utilities, Modern-Advanced mode for API services").

> **Note:** The mode primarily affects type hint requirements and framework usage patterns. Core style rules (naming, formatting, error handling) apply to both modes.

### Adjusting Line Length

The Python instructions reference a line length target of **<= 100** characters:

```markdown
- **[All]** **MUST** follow PEP 8/PEP 257; line length target **<= 100**
```

This setting should be consistent with your formatting tools in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: https://github.com/psf/black
  hooks:
    - id: black
      args: [--line-length=100]

- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  hooks:
    - id: ruff-check
      args: [--fix, --line-length=100]
```

**To use Black's default of 88 characters:**

1. Update `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to use `--line-length=88` for both Black and Ruff
2. Update the line length reference in `python.instructions.md`:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** **MUST** follow PEP 8/PEP 257; line length target **<= 88**
   ```

> **Note:** Ensure Black, Ruff, and the instruction file all use the same line length to avoid conflicts between Copilot-generated code and formatting tools.

### Customizing Type Hint Requirements

The file has different type hint expectations based on mode:

**Baseline Mode:**

```markdown
- **[Baseline]** **MAY** use type hints opportunistically for public APIs and complex structures.
```

**Modern-Advanced Mode:**

```markdown
- **[Modern]** Type hints are expected broadly; **MUST** run static checking (e.g., mypy/pyright) in CI.
```

**To customize for your project:**

1. **To require type hints everywhere:** Update the Baseline guidance to match Modern-Advanced requirements. Change `MAY` to `MUST` and add static checking requirements:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** **MUST** use type hints for all function signatures and complex variables.
   - **[All]** **MUST** run static checking (mypy/pyright) in CI.
   ```

2. **To relax type hint requirements:** For projects where type hints are not a priority, update both mode sections to use `MAY` or `SHOULD`:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** **SHOULD** use type hints for public APIs.
   - **[All]** **MAY** omit type hints for internal/private functions.
   ```

3. **For gradual adoption:** Document a migration path based on project maturity:

   ```markdown
   - New modules **MUST** include type hints for all public APIs.
   - Legacy modules **SHOULD** add type hints when modified.
   ```

> **Note:** If requiring strict type checking, ensure your CI workflow (`.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`) runs mypy without `continue-on-error: true`. See [CI Workflow Configuration](#ci-workflow-configuration) for details.

### Adjusting Documentation Standards

The file requires docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions:

```markdown
- **[All]** Every public module/class/function **MUST** have a docstring.
- **[All]** Docstrings **MUST** emphasize contract: inputs, outputs, errors, edge cases, examples.
```

The default docstring format includes:

- Short summary line
- Longer description if needed
- Args, Returns, Raises sections
- Examples for tricky behavior

**To customize for your project:**

1. **To relax requirements for internal/private functions:** Add guidance that distinguishes between public and private documentation needs:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** Every public module/class/function **MUST** have a docstring.
   - **[All]** Private functions (prefixed with `_`) **SHOULD** have a docstring but **MAY** use a brief one-line summary.
   - **[All]** Internal helper functions **MAY** omit docstrings if their purpose is obvious from context.
   ```

2. **To enforce a specific docstring style:** Add explicit style guidance such as Google style, NumPy style, or reStructuredText:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** Docstrings **MUST** use Google style format.
   ```

3. **To require examples for all public functions:** Strengthen the example requirement:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** Public functions **MUST** include at least one example in the docstring.
   ```

> **Note:** The instruction file uses a Google-style format (Args, Returns, Raises). If your project uses a different convention, update the example in the "Docstrings" section accordingly.

### Customizing Testing Requirements

The file specifies testing requirements for Python code:

```markdown
- **[All]** Tests **MUST** exist for non-trivial logic; **SHOULD** use `pytest` unless repo standard differs.
```

**To customize for your project:**

1. **To specify a different test framework:** If your project uses `unittest` or another framework, update the guidance:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** Tests **MUST** exist for non-trivial logic; **SHOULD** use `unittest`.
   ```

2. **To add coverage requirements:** Specify minimum coverage thresholds:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** Tests **MUST** exist for non-trivial logic; **SHOULD** use `pytest`.
   - **[All]** Test coverage **SHOULD** be >= 80% for new code.
   ```

3. **To require specific test patterns:** Add guidance for test organization:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** Tests **SHOULD** be placed in `tests/` directory mirroring the `src/` structure.
   - **[All]** Test files **MUST** use `test_*.py` naming convention.
   - **[All]** **SHOULD** use table-driven tests for parsing/validation logic.
   ```

4. **To relax testing requirements for prototypes:** Add context-dependent guidance:

   ```markdown
   - **[All]** Production code **MUST** have tests for non-trivial logic.
   - **[All]** Prototype/experimental code **SHOULD** have tests but **MAY** defer coverage.
   ```

> **Note:** Testing configuration (pytest settings, coverage thresholds) is typically managed in `pyproject.toml`. See the "Testing" section in that file for related settings.

## Copilot PowerShell Instructions Configuration

**File:** `.github/instructions/powershell.instructions.md`

The `powershell.instructions.md` file provides comprehensive PowerShell coding standards that GitHub Copilot applies when generating or editing `.ps1` files in your repository. These standards define naming conventions, documentation requirements, error handling patterns, and compatibility guidelines for both legacy (v1.0) and modern (v5.1+/v7.x+) PowerShell environments.

Teams may want to customize these standards to match their project's specific requirements and preferences.

### Customizing Variable Naming Conventions

The file defaults to Hungarian-style type-prefixed variable naming for local variables, particularly in v1.0-targeted code:

```powershell
$strMessage    # String
$intCount      # Integer
$boolResult    # Boolean
$arrElements   # Array
$objInstance   # Object
```

Teams with modern codebases that have strong IDE support (IntelliSense, type inference) may prefer plain camelCase:

```powershell
$message
$count
$result
$elements
$instance
```

**To change this preference, update the following sections:**

1. **"Local Variable Naming: Type-Prefixed camelCase"** section - Modify the naming rules and examples
2. **"Options for Local Variable Prefixes: Analysis"** table - Update the recommendation based on your choice
3. **Quick Reference Checklist** - Update the item referencing variable naming conventions (the `[v1.0]` scoped item about local variables)

> **Note:** If your project exclusively targets modern PowerShell (5.1+, 7.x), plain camelCase is generally preferred as IDEs provide type information. Type prefixes are most valuable in v1.0 environments or when editing without IDE support.

### Choosing Between v1.0 and Modern Patterns

The file distinguishes between two function architecture styles:

**v1.0-targeted:**

- Uses `trap` for error handling
- No `[CmdletBinding()]` attribute
- Explicit integer return codes (0=success, -1=failure)
- Reference parameters (`[ref]`) for outputs
- No pipeline input support

**Modern (v2.0+):**

- Uses `try/catch` for error handling
- Requires `[CmdletBinding()]` attribute
- Streaming output to pipeline
- `Write-Verbose` and `Write-Debug` for diagnostics
- Full pipeline support

**To customize for your environment:**

- **Modern-only projects (PowerShell 5.1+, 7.x):** Remove or de-emphasize the v1.0 sections. Update the Quick Reference Checklist to remove items tagged `[v1.0]` and make `[Modern]` items the default.

- **Legacy compatibility projects:** Keep the v1.0 sections as primary guidance. Update the "Executive Summary: Author Profile" to emphasize v1.0 compatibility as the default.

- **Mixed environments:** Keep both patterns but clarify when each applies based on your specific criteria (e.g., "Use v1.0 patterns for standalone utilities, Modern patterns for module functions").

### Adjusting Documentation Requirements

The file requires comprehensive comment-based help for all functions, including:

- `.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.PARAMETER`, `.EXAMPLE`, `.INPUTS`, `.OUTPUTS`, `.NOTES`
- Version number in `.NOTES` (format: `Major.Minor.YYYYMMDD.Revision`)
- Multiple examples with input, output, and explanation

**Teams may want to customize these requirements:**

1. **For internal/private helper functions:** Relax requirements in the "Comment-Based Help: Structure and Format" section to allow minimal documentation (e.g., `.SYNOPSIS` only) for private helper functions.

2. **For versioning format:** Update the "Function and Script Versioning" section if your project uses a different versioning scheme (e.g., SemVer without date component):

   ```powershell
   # Alternative format
   # .NOTES
   # Version: 1.2.3
   ```

3. **For example requirements:** Reduce the requirement for multiple examples in the "Help Content Quality: High Standards" section if this is too burdensome for your team.

> **Note:** Even with relaxed requirements, maintaining at least `.SYNOPSIS` for all functions is strongly recommended for discoverability with `Get-Help`.

### Customizing Brace Style Preference

The file enforces OTBS (One True Brace Style) where opening braces are placed on the same line as the statement:

```powershell
# OTBS (default)
if ($condition) {
    # code
} else {
    # code
}
```

Some teams prefer Allman style (braces on new lines):

```powershell
# Allman style
if ($condition)
{
    # code
}
else
{
    # code
}
```

**To change brace style:**

1. Update the "Brace Placement (OTBS)" section in this file to reflect your preferred style
2. Update `.github/linting/PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` to match (see [PSScriptAnalyzer Configuration](#psscriptanalyzer-configuration) for details)

> **Note:** Brace style must be consistent between the instruction file and PSScriptAnalyzer settings. Inconsistent settings will cause conflicts between Copilot-generated code and linting rules.

### Adjusting Error Handling Patterns

The file documents specific return code conventions for v1.0-targeted functions:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Full success |
| `1-5` | Partial success with additional data |
| `-1` | Complete failure |

**To customize for your project:**

1. **Different return codes:** Update the "Return Semantics: Explicit Status Codes" section with your project's conventions. For example, some projects use positive integers for all error codes:

   ```powershell
   # Alternative convention
   # 0 = Success
   # 1 = General error
   # 2 = File not found
   # 3 = Permission denied
   ```

2. **Exception-based patterns:** For modern-only projects, you may prefer to rely entirely on exceptions rather than return codes. Update the "Modern catch Block Requirements" section to document your exception handling patterns.

3. **Custom exception types:** If your project defines custom exception types, document them and update the error handling sections accordingly.

## Copilot Terraform Instructions Configuration

**File:** `.github/instructions/terraform.instructions.md`

The `terraform.instructions.md` file provides Terraform coding standards that GitHub Copilot applies when generating or editing `.tf`, `.tfvars`, `.tftest.hcl`, `.tf.json`, `.tftpl`, and `.tfbackend` files in your repository. These standards cover style, formatting, naming conventions, file organization, variable and output design, resource configuration, module design, state management, security best practices, provider management, testing, and documentation requirements.

### Adopting for Terraform Projects

When adopting this template for a Terraform project, complete the following tasks:

1. **Update the metadata** at the top of the file to reflect your project's ownership and versioning
2. **Review and adjust backend configuration** guidance for your project needs (S3, Azure Storage, GCS, Terraform Cloud, etc.)
3. **Verify required provider versions** and update the version constraint examples as needed
4. **Add organization-specific required tags** to the Required Tags section if your organization mandates specific tags
5. **Document any justified deviations** in the "Scope Exceptions & Deviations from Standards" section at the end of the file
6. **Remove non-relevant provider examples** — The file includes parallel examples for AWS, Azure, and GCP. Delete examples for providers your project does not use to reduce noise and confusion. Search for "AWS Example", "Azure Example", "GCP Example", and combined labels like "AWS/Azure Example" to identify provider-specific blocks.
7. **Replace all `REPLACE_ME_*` placeholders** with your organization's actual values. Run `grep -r "REPLACE_ME"` to find all placeholders requiring customization.

### Customizing Provider Examples

The file now includes parallel examples for AWS, Azure, and GCP throughout. Each example group is clearly labeled with "AWS Example", "Azure Example", "GCP Example", or combined labels like "AWS/Azure Example" (used when providers share the same pattern). To customize for your cloud provider:

1. **For single-provider projects:** Remove examples for providers you don't use. Search for the provider labels (e.g., "Azure Example", "GCP Example") and delete those code blocks and their headers.

2. **For multi-cloud projects:** Keep all examples or remove only those that don't apply to your specific environments.

3. **For all projects:** Replace `REPLACE_ME_*` placeholders with your organization's actual values. See the "Placeholder Convention (`REPLACE_ME_*`)" section in `.github/instructions/terraform.instructions.md` for the complete list of standard placeholders.

### Customizing for Terraform Cloud/Enterprise

If your organization uses Terraform Cloud, Terraform Enterprise, Spacelift, or similar tools:

1. **Update the State Management section** to reflect your workflow. The `backend.tf` file may not be applicable.

2. **Add cloud block configuration** guidance as the primary example:

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     cloud {
       organization = "REPLACE_ME_ORG"
       workspaces {
         name = "REPLACE_ME_WORKSPACE"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Document which sections do not apply** in the Scope Exceptions section. For example:
   - Manual `backend.tf` configuration
   - DynamoDB lock table configuration
   - S3/GCS/Azure Storage bucket configuration for state

### Customizing Required Tags

The Required Tags section lists mandatory tags for all taggable resources. To customize for your organization:

1. **Add organization-specific tags:**

   ```markdown
   | Tag | Description | Example |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `CostCenter` | Budget/billing code | `CC-12345` |
   | `Department` | Owning department | `Engineering` |
   | `Compliance` | Compliance framework | `SOC2`, `HIPAA` |
   ```

2. **Remove tags that don't apply** to your organization

3. **Update the Default Tags Configuration** example to reflect your required tags

### Scope Exceptions Section

The file includes a "Scope Exceptions & Deviations from Standards" section at the end for documenting justified deviations. Use this section to record:

- **Alternative backend workflows:** Using Terraform Cloud instead of `backend.tf`
- **Provider-specific requirements:** Organization policies that mandate specific provider configurations
- **Legacy compatibility:** Maintaining compatibility with older Terraform versions or modules
- **Organizational naming conventions:** Pre-existing naming conventions that differ from the template
- **Security policy overrides:** Stricter security requirements that go beyond the template defaults

---

## Copilot Main Instructions Configuration

**File:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

The main `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file provides repository-wide instructions that GitHub Copilot applies when generating or editing code. It includes sections on pre-commit discipline, testing tools, and other project-wide standards. These sections should be customized to match your project's actual tools and workflows.

### Protected Instruction-File Cleanup

The template protects `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/**`, `.cursor/rules/**`, and root agent files such as `.hermes.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md`. During stack selection:

1. Complete non-protected cleanup first, such as unused workflows, examples, templates, and lint configuration.
2. Record the adoption mode for the protected files that remain. Use `minimal-preservation` by default; choose `tailored` only when the maintainer explicitly approves broader rewriting for named files.
3. Record the protected-file changes needed to remove references to deleted tools or stacks.
4. Get explicit maintainer authorization for those protected-file edits. `minimal-preservation` limits the scope of an authorized edit but does not authorize protected-file changes by itself.
5. Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, remaining root agent files, and relevant `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files.
6. Bump `Last Updated` and `Version` metadata where those fields exist.
7. Avoid temporary migration wording in governance docs that downstream maintainers will keep.

### Customizing the Pre-commit Discipline Section

The Pre-commit Discipline section (near the top of `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) tells Copilot how to run pre-commit checks, what commands to use, and how to handle CI failures. This ensures Copilot generates code that follows your project's code quality workflow.

The default configuration assumes:

- The [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework with `pre-commit run --all-files`
- npm-based markdown linting with `npm run lint:md`
- A `copilot/**` branch pattern for automated fixes

**To customize for your project:**

1. **Different pre-commit tools:** If you use a different tool (e.g., Husky, lefthook, or custom scripts), update the workflow section:

   ```markdown
   **Workflow:**

   1. Make your code changes
   2. Run pre-commit checks locally (e.g., `npx husky run` or `make lint`)
   3. Review and commit ALL auto-fixes as part of your change
   4. Push to GitHub
   ```

2. **Different linting commands:** Update command examples to match your project:

   ```markdown
   **Workflow:**

   1. Make your code changes
   2. Run pre-commit checks locally (e.g., `make lint` or `./scripts/lint.sh`)
   3. Review and commit ALL auto-fixes as part of your change
   4. Push to GitHub
   ```

3. **No pre-commit framework:** If your project uses only CI-based checks without local pre-commit hooks, simplify the section:

   ```markdown
   ## Pre-commit Discipline (CRITICAL)

   **⚠️ ALWAYS run linting checks before committing code.**

   **Workflow:**

   1. Make your code changes
   2. Run linting locally: `npm run lint` (or your project's lint command)
   3. Review and fix all issues before committing
   4. Push to GitHub

   **If CI fails:**

   1. Pull the latest branch
   2. Run linting locally and fix issues
   3. Commit fixes
   4. Push again
   ```

4. **Different branch patterns for automated fixes:** If you use a different branch naming convention for AI-generated PRs, update the Auto-Fix Workflow section to match (and update the corresponding workflow file).

> **Note:** The pre-commit section should accurately reflect your project's tooling. Incorrect instructions will cause Copilot to suggest wrong commands or skip necessary checks.

### Customizing the Testing Tools Section

The Testing Tools section (near the bottom of `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) tells Copilot what test frameworks your project uses, where tests are located, and how to run them. This ensures Copilot generates tests that match your project's conventions.

The default configuration includes:

| Language | Framework | Configuration | Test Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python | pytest | `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`) | `tests/` |
| PowerShell | Pester 5.x | Inline in `.github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml` | `tests/PowerShell/` |

**To customize for your project:**

1. **Different test frameworks:** Update the table to reflect your actual frameworks:

   ```markdown
   ## Testing Tools

   This repository includes testing infrastructure for the following languages:

   | Language | Framework | Configuration | Test Location |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Python | unittest | `setup.cfg` | `tests/` |
   | JavaScript | Jest | `jest.config.js` | `__tests__/` |
   | TypeScript | Vitest | `vitest.config.ts` | `src/**/*.test.ts` |
   ```

2. **Different test locations:** Update the table and running instructions to match your directory structure:

   ```markdown
   | Language | Framework | Configuration | Test Location |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Python | pytest | `pytest.ini` | `spec/` |
   | Ruby | RSpec | `.rspec` | `spec/` |
   ```

3. **Update the "Running Tests" section:** Ensure the commands match your setup (this example shows commands for Jest and unittest, matching the frameworks in example 1):

   ````markdown
   ### Running Tests

   **JavaScript:**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   **Python:**

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```
   ````

4. **Single-language projects:** Remove rows for languages you don't use:

   ````markdown
   ## Testing Tools

   This repository uses pytest for testing:

   | Language | Framework | Configuration | Test Location |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Python | pytest | `pyproject.toml` | `tests/` |

   ### Running Tests

   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```
   ````

5. **Additional test types:** If your project includes integration tests, end-to-end tests, or other test types, document them:

   ```markdown
   ## Testing Tools

   | Test Type | Framework | Configuration | Location |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Unit tests | pytest | `pyproject.toml` | `tests/unit/` |
   | Integration tests | pytest | `pyproject.toml` | `tests/integration/` |
   | E2E tests | Playwright | `playwright.config.ts` | `tests/e2e/` |
   ```

> **Note:** Keep the Testing Tools section synchronized with your actual test configuration. Incorrect information will cause Copilot to generate tests in wrong locations or using wrong frameworks.

### Updating Related Sections

When customizing the Pre-commit or Testing sections, you may also need to update these related sections in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

- **How to Work (Definition of Done):** Update test location references (e.g., `tests/` to `spec/`)
- **Modular Instructions table:** Ensure it matches your instruction files
- **Linting Configurations:** Update linting tool references if you use different linters

---

## Customizing Agent Instruction Files

**Files:** `.cursor/rules/repository-instructions.mdc`, `.hermes.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`

The template includes agent instruction files at the repository root and under platform-specific rule directories. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` remains the canonical source of truth, while these files act as thin entry points that keep a minimal inline summary of the highest-priority shared rules plus any platform-specific guidance. Each file targets a specific AI coding platform:

| File | Target Agent(s) |
| --- | --- |
| `.cursor/rules/repository-instructions.mdc` | Cursor Agent |
| `.hermes.md` | Hermes Agent |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code, GitHub Copilot coding agent |
| `AGENTS.md` | OpenAI Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot coding agent |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini Code Assist, GitHub Copilot coding agent |

### Removing Unneeded Files

Delete agent files for platforms you do not use. For example, if your team does not use Cursor Agent, delete `.cursor/rules/repository-instructions.mdc`. If your team does not use Hermes Agent, delete `.hermes.md`. If your team does not use Claude Code, delete `CLAUDE.md`. If your team does not use OpenAI Codex CLI, delete `AGENTS.md`. Removing unused files reduces maintenance burden without affecting other platforms.

### Keeping Minimal Summaries Aligned

When high-priority shared guidance changes in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, update the minimal summaries in any remaining agent files as needed. Common changes that require alignment include:

- **Language table updates** — Adding or removing languages
- **Linting tool changes** — Different linting commands or configurations
- **Test command changes** — Different test frameworks or commands
- **Build and test commands** — Updated pre-commit or CI commands
- **Canonical-file guidance** — Changes to how agents should locate or interpret the canonical instructions

> **Note:** No CI enforcement exists for agent-file alignment. Review the remaining agent files whenever you update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` so their minimal summaries stay accurate without regrowing into full duplicates.

### Adding Platform-Specific Notes

If an agent has unique behavioral requirements (e.g., different command syntax, specific tool limitations, or platform-specific workarounds), add agent-specific sections to the appropriate file. Platform-specific notes should supplement, not contradict, the canonical rules in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

---

## Codex Plugin Configuration

**File:** `.codex/config.toml`

The template includes a project-scoped Codex configuration file at `.codex/config.toml` that opts trusted Codex checkouts of this repository into the OpenAI-curated GitHub plugin (`github@openai-curated`). When the plugin is enabled and authorized, Codex prefers it for GitHub operations such as reading issues and pull requests, posting PR and review comments, managing labels and reactions, and creating pull requests, instead of treating the absence of the `gh` CLI as a blocker. See the **GitHub Plugin Usage** and **PR Review Workflow (Codex-adapted)** sections in `AGENTS.md` for the full Codex workflow that depends on this plugin.

### What enabling the plugin does and does not grant

Enabling the plugin in `.codex/config.toml` only opts the plugin in for trusted Codex checkouts that read this configuration. It does **not**, by itself:

- install the GitHub app or connector for the Codex account performing the operation,
- grant access to any specific repository or organization,
- bypass any branch protection, required status check, or signing requirement, or
- change the permissions of the GitHub identity Codex uses at runtime.

Actual GitHub access still depends on the GitHub app/connector installation, the Codex account performing the operation, and the repository's permissions. Treat `.codex/config.toml` as an opt-in switch, not a credential.

### Removing the file

If your team does not use OpenAI Codex CLI, you can safely delete `.codex/config.toml` (and the empty `.codex/` directory it lives in). Removing the file does not affect any other agent or platform; the file is consumed only by Codex. If you also delete the `AGENTS.md` agent instruction file (see **Customizing Agent Instruction Files** above), removing `.codex/config.toml` keeps the repository's Codex-facing surface area aligned with what your team actually uses.

### Keeping the file but disabling the plugin

If you keep `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/config.toml` but want to disable the GitHub plugin for this checkout (for example, while testing a different GitHub integration), set `enabled = false` instead of removing the file:

```toml
[plugins."github@openai-curated"]
enabled = false
```

This preserves the configuration as a discoverable record that the project considered the plugin and chose to disable it, rather than leaving readers to guess from the absence of a config file.

### Verifying the plugin name

The plugin identifier `github@openai-curated` follows OpenAI's curated-plugin naming convention (`<plugin-name>@openai-curated`). If OpenAI renames the curated GitHub plugin in a future Codex release, update the quoted key in `.codex/config.toml` to match the new identifier; a typo in the plugin name is a silent no-op rather than an error, so the file would otherwise stop having any effect without a visible warning.

### Pre-commit and CI validation

The `check-toml` hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (from `pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks`) validates the syntax of `.codex/config.toml` (and any other `*.toml` file in the repository) on every `pre-commit run --all-files`. The dedicated `.github/workflows/data-ci.yml` workflow also invokes `pre-commit run check-toml --all-files` as a step alongside `check-json`, `check-yaml`, `yamllint`, `actionlint`, `check-jsonschema`, and `check-metaschema`, so TOML syntax is enforced as a first-class CI check that can be required via branch protection independently of the broader Python CI pipeline. If you remove `.codex/config.toml` and the repository contains no other TOML files you want validated, you may also remove both the `check-toml` hook from `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and the matching `Run check-toml` step from `.github/workflows/data-ci.yml`; otherwise, leave them in place so future TOML additions are automatically validated.

---

## CI Workflow Configuration

### Aggregate Pre-commit CI

**File:** `.github/workflows/precommit-ci.yml`

The template ships a baseline-scoped aggregate workflow that installs Python only as the runtime for pre-commit and Python-based hooks, then runs `pre-commit run --all-files`. Keep this workflow when removing Python project source, because `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` now contains only Python-specific jobs such as mypy and pytest.

Remove `.github/workflows/precommit-ci.yml` only if the downstream repository removes `.pre-commit-config.yaml` entirely or replaces aggregate pre-commit enforcement with an equivalent required CI check.

### Enabling Codecov Integration

Uncomment the Codecov step to enable code coverage reporting:

```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}  # Required for private repos only
    files: ./coverage.xml
    flags: unittests
    name: codecov-umbrella
    fail_ci_if_error: false
```

> **Note:** Public repositories do not require a token. For private repositories, add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to your repository secrets.

### Making Type Checking Strict

The mypy step stays advisory in adopter repositories by default:

```yaml
- name: Run mypy
  shell: bash
  run: |
    targets=(src tests)
    if [ -d .template-sync/scripts ]; then
      targets+=(.template-sync/scripts)
    fi
    python -m mypy "${targets[@]}"
  continue-on-error: ${{ github.repository != 'franklesniak/copilot-repo-template' }}
```

**Once your project has full type coverage**, remove the `continue-on-error` line or set it to `false` to make type checking a required check.

### Customizing Python Version Matrix

The test matrix runs on the template's currently bugfix-supported Python lines by default:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ['3.13', '3.14']
```

**To narrow or expand the matrix for your own support policy:**

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ['3.14']
```

> **Note:** Only test Python versions currently receiving bugfix updates unless your project has a separate long-term-support policy. Security-fix-only versions require building from source and are not recommended for this template's default CI.

### Customizing Test Paths

The Bash `targets` array in `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` controls which directories mypy checks:

```yaml
run: |
  targets=(src tests)
  if [ -d .template-sync/scripts ]; then
    targets+=(.template-sync/scripts)
  fi
  python -m mypy "${targets[@]}"
```

**Common configurations:**

- Flat layout: `targets=(.)`
- src layout: `targets=(src tests)`
- Custom: `targets=(mymodule tests scripts/check.py)`

### Customizing Dependency Installation

The CI workflow installs the project with development dependencies using:

```yaml
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This command appears in both the `type-check` and `test` jobs.

**To use different dependency groups:**

If your `pyproject.toml` uses a different optional dependency group name:

```yaml
# For a [project.optional-dependencies] section named "test"
pip install -e ".[test]"

# For multiple groups
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
```

**To use requirements.txt instead:**

If your project uses `requirements.txt` files instead of `pyproject.toml` optional dependencies:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If you have separate dev requirements
```

> **Note:** Update both the `type-check` job and the `test` job to keep them consistent.

---

## Auto-fix Pre-commit Workflow Configuration

**File:** `.github/workflows/auto-fix-precommit.yml`

The template includes an optional workflow that automatically runs pre-commit hooks and commits any auto-fixes (such as formatting corrections and trailing whitespace removal) for branches created by the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent.

### Understanding the Workflow

This workflow:

- Triggers only on `copilot/**` branches when pushed by `copilot-swe-agent[bot]`
- Runs pre-commit hooks with auto-fix enabled
- Commits any changes back to the branch automatically
- Helps AI-assisted development pass pre-commit checks without manual intervention

> **Recommendation:** Keep this workflow enabled if you use GitHub Copilot Coding Agent. The safety net significantly reduces the need for manual pre-commit fix commits.

### When to Keep This Workflow

Keep this workflow if:

- You plan to use GitHub Copilot Coding Agent for automated PRs
- You want a safety net that auto-fixes pre-commit issues on `copilot/**` branches
- You prefer automated fixes over manual intervention

### Removing This Workflow

If you don't use GitHub Copilot Coding Agent or prefer to manually commit pre-commit fixes, you can safely remove this workflow.

> **Note:** Removing this workflow is safe if another workflow still reports pre-commit failures. If you removed Python project CI but kept pre-commit hooks, keep `.github/workflows/precommit-ci.yml` or another aggregate required check as described in [Aggregate Pre-commit CI](#aggregate-pre-commit-ci).

**Steps to remove:**

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path ".github/workflows/auto-fix-precommit.yml" -Force
```

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

```bash
rm -f .github/workflows/auto-fix-precommit.yml
```

---

## Placeholder Check Workflow Configuration

**File:** `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml`

The placeholder check workflow verifies that template placeholders (`OWNER/REPO`, `@OWNER`, `[security contact email]` when retained by the selected security reporting mode) have been replaced. Treat it as transitional adoption tooling, not a permanent requirement for every downstream repository.

### Understanding the Workflow

The workflow uses automatic detection to determine whether to run:

```yaml
if: github.repository != 'franklesniak/copilot-repo-template'
```

This means the workflow:

- **Runs automatically** in your repository (no configuration needed)
- **Is disabled** only in the original template repository

### When to Keep This Workflow

Keep this workflow if you:

- Are still replacing `OWNER/REPO`, `@OWNER`, `[security contact email]`, or similar template placeholders
- Plan to make future updates from the template that might introduce new placeholder files
- Want a safety net to catch accidental placeholder remnants
- Have contributors who might add files with placeholder patterns

### Removing This Workflow

If the repository is initialized, all placeholders have been replaced with concrete downstream values, and you do not anticipate needing this check, remove the workflow:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Force ".github\workflows\check-placeholders.yml"
```

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

```bash
rm -f .github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml
```

After removal, update any docs that imply the workflow still exists, do not reintroduce live `OWNER/REPO` placeholders, and prefer concrete downstream repository URLs in issue templates, PR templates, and community-health docs. The placeholder workflow can no longer catch drift once it is removed.

### Adding Custom Placeholder Patterns

If your project uses additional placeholder patterns that should be checked, edit `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml` and locate the "Additional placeholder patterns check" step. Find the `PATTERNS` array and add your custom patterns:

```yaml
- name: Additional placeholder patterns check
  run: |
    # ... existing code ...
    PATTERNS=(
      "your-org"
      "your-repo"
      "YOUR_ORG"
      "YOUR_REPO"
      "YOUR_CUSTOM_PLACEHOLDER"  # Add your custom patterns here
    )
```

### Converting Warnings to Hard Failures

By default, some checks in the "Additional placeholder patterns check" step produce warnings rather than failures (e.g., `Project Name` in README.md, patterns in PR templates). To make these hard failures, edit `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml` and change the warning-only sections to set `FOUND_PLACEHOLDERS=true`:

```yaml
# Before (warning only):
if grep -n "^# Project Name$" README.md; then
  echo "::warning file=README.md::Found 'Project Name' placeholder..."
  FOUND_WARNINGS=true
fi

# After (hard failure):
if grep -n "^# Project Name$" README.md; then
  echo "::error file=README.md::Found 'Project Name' placeholder..."
  FOUND_PLACEHOLDERS=true  # Changed from FOUND_WARNINGS
fi
```

## PowerShell CI Workflow Configuration

**File:** `.github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml`

The PowerShell CI workflow runs PSScriptAnalyzer linting and Pester tests for PowerShell scripts. It runs automatically on every push and pull request and automatically skips if no PowerShell files are found in the repository.

### Understanding the Workflow

The workflow consists of two jobs:

1. **powershell-lint** (display name: "Lint (PSScriptAnalyzer)"): Runs PSScriptAnalyzer on all `.ps1` files (skips if no files found)
2. **test** (display name: "PowerShell Tests (Pester)"): Runs Pester tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux (skips if no `*.Tests.ps1` files found)

The workflow uses automatic detection, so you don't need to configure anything if you have PowerShell files—it just works.

### Choosing the PSScriptAnalyzer Gate Mode

The lint job reads `PSSCRIPTANALYZER_GATE_MODE` before deciding whether analyzer findings fail CI. Supported values are:

- `strict` (default): Error, Warning, and unknown-severity findings fail CI. Information findings are annotated only.
- `first-adoption`: Error and unknown-severity findings fail CI. Warning and Information findings are annotated as tracked debt without failing the lint job.

Missing, empty, or unrecognized values resolve to `strict`. This keeps the template default strict even when a downstream repository removes or misconfigures the environment variable.

Use `first-adoption` only for existing repositories that already have PSScriptAnalyzer warning debt at the moment they adopt the workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  powershell-lint:
    env:
      PSSCRIPTANALYZER_GATE_MODE: first-adoption
```

When this mode is enabled, record the warning debt in `_TODO-repo-init.md` during first adoption, or in one or more post-adoption issues after the repository is initialized. Include the CI summary counts, affected rules, owner, and expected removal date. Return `PSSCRIPTANALYZER_GATE_MODE` to `strict` after Warning findings are remediated. Do not change `.github/linting/PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` merely to make first-adoption mode work.

### Customizing Pester Test Paths

By default, Pester tests are run from the `tests/` directory. To use a different directory, modify the `$config.Run.Path` setting in the "Run Pester tests" step:

```powershell
$config.Run.Path = "your_tests_directory/"  # Change from default "tests/"
```

### Customizing Test Output Format

The default test output format is `NUnitXml`. To use a different format:

```powershell
$config.TestResult.OutputFormat = "JUnitXml"  # Default is "NUnitXml"
```

Available formats include `NUnitXml`, `JUnitXml`, and `NUnit2.5`.

### Customizing the OS Matrix

By default, Pester tests run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

**To run on fewer operating systems:**

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [windows-latest]  # Windows only
```

**To run on Windows and Linux only:**

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```

### Adding Path-Based Filtering

The template deliberately does not use path-based filtering because this is a template repository where all workflows should run on all changes for testing purposes. However, consumers of the template can add path filtering for efficiency:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["**"]
    paths:
      - "**/*.ps1"
      - ".github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml"
      - ".github/linting/PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1"
      - "src/tools/*.ps1"
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]
    paths:
      - "**/*.ps1"
      - ".github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml"
      - ".github/linting/PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1"
      - "src/tools/*.ps1"
```

> **Note:** Include configuration files in the path filter to ensure the workflow runs when linting rules or the workflow itself changes.

### Removing the Workflow

If your project doesn't use PowerShell, you can remove the workflow:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path ".github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml" -Force
```

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

```bash
rm -f .github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml
```

> **Note:** If you want to remove all PowerShell-related files from the repository (not just the workflow), see the "If NOT Using PowerShell" section in [GETTING_STARTED_NEW_REPO.md](GETTING_STARTED_NEW_REPO.md) for comprehensive removal instructions.

## Using the Python Template Files

**Directory:** `templates/python/`

This template repository includes reference Python configuration files and scaffolding for projects adopting Python tooling. These files demonstrate how to configure Python tooling to align with the coding standards defined in [`.github/instructions/python.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/python.instructions.md).

### Files Included

- **`pyproject.toml`**: Sample configuration for Python project metadata, dependencies, and tooling (Black, Ruff, mypy, pytest)
- **`tests/__init__.py`**: Package marker for the test directory
- **`tests/test_placeholder.py`**: Placeholder test file that demonstrates pytest test structure
- **`tests/test_schema_examples.py`**: Starter pytest module that auto-discovers and validates schema example fixtures under `schemas/examples/<name>/{valid,invalid}/` with `check-jsonschema`. Skips cleanly when the tool is not installed or when no examples are present. Mirrors the active, canonical test at `tests/test_schema_examples.py` in the template repository root. See [Schema Validation Configuration](#schema-validation-configuration) for setup.
- **`README.md`**: Brief overview of the template files with links to external resources

### How to Use the Template

1. **Copy files to your project root** (or appropriate location based on your layout):

   **Windows (PowerShell):**

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Path "templates/python/pyproject.toml" -Destination "pyproject.toml"
   Copy-Item -Path "templates/python/tests" -Destination "tests" -Recurse
   ```

   **macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

   ```bash
   cp templates/python/pyproject.toml pyproject.toml
   cp -r templates/python/tests tests
   ```

2. **Customize `pyproject.toml`**:
   - Update the `[project]` section with your project's name, version, description, and authors
   - Add your runtime dependencies to the `dependencies = []` list
   - Adjust development dependencies as needed
   - Update the `classifiers` list to reflect your project's maturity and supported Python versions (see below)

3. **Create your source code** in either a flat layout (modules in project root) or `src/` layout (modules in `src/your_package/`). See the [Project Layout Options](#project-layout-options) section below for detailed layout options and directory structure examples.

4. **Replace or delete `tests/test_placeholder.py`** once you have actual tests in place.

### About the Placeholder File

The file `templates/python/tests/test_placeholder.py` is a minimal placeholder that demonstrates pytest test structure. It contains a single test that always passes:

```python
"""Placeholder test file for template demonstration.

This is a template file. Delete or overwrite this with your actual tests.
"""


def test_placeholder():
    """Simple placeholder test that always passes.

    Replace this with your actual test cases.
    """
    assert True
```

When you add real tests for your project:

1. Create test files following the `test_*.py` naming convention
2. Delete `test_placeholder.py` once you have real tests in place
3. See the [Python Version Configuration](#python-version-configuration) and [mypy Path Configuration](#mypy-path-configuration) sections below for additional configuration details

### Customizing Classifiers

The `classifiers` field in `pyproject.toml` provides metadata for PyPI and other tools. Update these values to match your project:

**Development Status:** Change based on project maturity:

```toml
# Alpha - early development, unstable API
"Development Status :: 3 - Alpha"

# Beta - feature complete, may have bugs
"Development Status :: 4 - Beta"

# Production/Stable - ready for production use
"Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable"
```

**Python Version Classifiers:** Update when your supported Python version window changes:

```toml
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.14",
]
```

> **Note:** The Python version classifiers should match the versions specified in `requires-python` and your CI test matrix. See [PyPI Classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) for the full list of available classifiers.

### When to Use These Templates

Use the Python template files when:

- **Starting a new Python project from scratch**: These templates provide clean configuration files that you can customize for your project
- **Adding Python to an existing repository**: If your repository doesn't have Python tooling configured, these templates provide a complete starting point

### Project Layout Options

#### Option 1: Flat Layout

Place your Python modules directly in the project root:

```text
your-project/
├── pyproject.toml
├── your_module.py
├── another_module.py
└── tests/
    └── test_your_module.py
```

For mypy in CI, use:

```yaml
run: |
  targets=(.)
  python -m mypy "${targets[@]}"
```

#### Option 2: src/ Layout (Recommended)

Place your Python package(s) in a `src/` directory:

```text
your-project/
├── pyproject.toml
├── src/
│   └── your_package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── module.py
└── tests/
    └── test_module.py
```

For mypy in CI, use:

```yaml
run: |
  targets=(src tests)
  python -m mypy "${targets[@]}"
```

The `src/` layout is recommended because it:

- Prevents accidental imports of uninstalled code during development
- Makes it clear what code is part of the package vs. project tooling
- Aligns with modern Python packaging best practices

### Python Version Configuration

Different Python tools require different version format specifications. When updating the Python support window, you must update the relevant settings together:

#### 1. Project Metadata: `requires-python`

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.13,<3.15"  # PEP 621 version range using dotted versions
```

#### 2. Black Configuration: `target-version`

```toml
[tool.black]
target-version = ["py313", "py314"]  # List of strings in "pyXYZ" format
```

#### 3. mypy Configuration: `python_version`

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.13"  # Lowest supported version, dotted string only
```

#### 4. Ruff Configuration: `target-version` (Optional)

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# Ruff automatically infers target-version from [project].requires-python
# Only set this if you need to override:
# target-version = "py313"  # Lowest supported version, single string (not a list)
```

**Important:** If you set `[project].requires-python`, Ruff will automatically use that value. Setting `[tool.ruff].target-version` explicitly will override the inferred value.

### Python Version Support Policy

**Always use a Python version that is currently receiving bugfixes.**

- Python versions in "security fix only" phase are **not publicly installable** with security updates—they require building from source with manually applied patches.
- Check the [Python Developer's Guide - Versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) page for current version status.

> **Template adopters:** The template currently defaults to Python 3.13 through 3.14. Customize the `requires-python` field in `pyproject.toml` based on your project's specific requirements.

**When to update:**

- Check the [Python Developer's Guide - Versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) page annually (typically around October when new Python versions are released)
- Update all version references in `pyproject.toml` when the supported version window changes
- Update the CI workflow's Python version matrix in `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`

### mypy Path Configuration

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`) uses a Bash `targets` array to specify which directories/files mypy should check.

**Default (for src/ layout):**

```yaml
run: |
  targets=(src tests)
  if [ -d .template-sync/scripts ]; then
    targets+=(.template-sync/scripts)
  fi
  python -m mypy "${targets[@]}"
```

**For flat layout:**

```yaml
run: |
  targets=(.)
  python -m mypy "${targets[@]}"
```

**For custom directories:**

```yaml
run: |
  targets=(foo bar baz.py)
  python -m mypy "${targets[@]}"
```

The command-line paths override any `files` or `exclude` settings in `pyproject.toml` or `mypy.ini` in terms of directory scope. However, per-file configuration options in those files still apply to the files that mypy discovers.

## Using the Pester Test Template

**File:** `templates/powershell/Example.Tests.ps1`

This template repository includes a comprehensive Pester 5.x test template that demonstrates common testing patterns. Use this template as a starting point when creating tests for your PowerShell functions.

### What the Template Demonstrates

The template file includes working examples of:

- **BeforeAll/BeforeEach** for test setup and dot-sourcing functions
- **Describe/Context/It** block structure for organizing tests
- **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)** pattern for clear test organization
- **Testing integer return codes** (0=success, -1=failure) for v1.0-style functions
- **Testing reference parameters** (`[ref]`) for functions that return data via references
- **Testing boolean returns** for `Test-*` functions
- **Basic mocking** with the `Mock` command to isolate tests from external dependencies

### How to Use the Template

1. **Copy the template file** to your tests directory:

   **Windows (PowerShell):**

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item "templates/powershell/Example.Tests.ps1" "tests/PowerShell/MyFunction.Tests.ps1"
   ```

   **macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

   ```bash
   cp templates/powershell/Example.Tests.ps1 tests/PowerShell/MyFunction.Tests.ps1
   ```

2. **Remove the inline example functions** from the `BeforeAll` block. These are demonstration functions (`Get-ExampleGreeting`, `Test-IsValidEmail`, `Get-ProcessedData`) that exist only to make the template runnable as-is.

3. **Uncomment and update the dot-source line** to import your actual function file:

   ```powershell
   BeforeAll {
       # Update this path to your actual function file
       . $PSScriptRoot/../../src/MyFunction.ps1
   }
   ```

4. **Replace the example `Describe` blocks** with tests for your actual functions, following the patterns demonstrated for your specific return types.

### Running the Template Tests

You can run the template file directly to see the test patterns in action:

```powershell
Invoke-Pester -Path templates/powershell/Example.Tests.ps1 -Output Detailed
```

### About the Placeholder File

The file `tests/PowerShell/Placeholder.Tests.ps1` is a minimal placeholder that exists to ensure the PowerShell CI workflow passes with a valid test file. When you add real tests for your project:

1. Copy the template file as described above
2. Customize it for your functions
3. Delete `Placeholder.Tests.ps1` once you have real tests in place

The template file provides much more comprehensive examples than the placeholder and should be your primary reference when writing Pester tests.

---

## PSScriptAnalyzer Configuration

**File:** `.github/linting/PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1`

### Adjusting Severity Levels

The default configuration enforces Error and Warning severity:

```powershell
Severity = @('Error', 'Warning')
```

The separate `PSSCRIPTANALYZER_GATE_MODE` workflow setting controls which reported severities fail CI. It does not change which severities PSScriptAnalyzer reports. With the default settings above, Information findings do not appear unless a downstream repository explicitly adds `Information` to the settings.

**To include informational messages:**

```powershell
Severity = @('Error', 'Warning', 'Information')
```

**To only enforce errors:**

```powershell
Severity = @('Error')
```

### Customizing Individual Rules

Each rule can be individually enabled or disabled:

```powershell
Rules = @{
    PSAvoidUsingCmdletAliases = @{
        Enable = $true  # or $false to disable
    }
}
```

For a complete list of available rules, see the [PSScriptAnalyzer documentation](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer).

### Relaxing Formatting Rules

For teams preferring different brace styles, modify the `PSPlaceOpenBrace` rule:

**Allman style (braces on new line):**

```powershell
PSPlaceOpenBrace = @{
    Enable = $true
    OnSameLine = $false
    NewLineAfter = $true
}
```

**To disable brace checking entirely:**

```powershell
PSPlaceOpenBrace = @{
    Enable = $false
}
PSPlaceCloseBrace = @{
    Enable = $false
}
```

---

## CODEOWNERS Configuration

**File:** `.github/CODEOWNERS`

### Adding Team-Based Ownership

Use team references for organization repositories:

```text
* @org/maintainers
.github/workflows/ @org/devops-team
docs/ @org/documentation-team
```

### Adding Path-Specific Ownership

Assign different owners for different directories:

```text
# Default owners
* @username

# Documentation
docs/ @docs-team
*.md @docs-team

# Tests
tests/ @qa-team

# Specific modules
src/api/ @api-team
src/frontend/ @frontend-team
```

### Multiple Owners

List multiple owners for the same pattern:

```text
# Both users will be requested for review
src/critical/ @senior-dev @tech-lead

# Team and individual
.github/ @org/maintainers @repo-admin
```

---

## Node.js Package Configuration

**File:** `package.json`

### Adding Application Metadata

For projects using Node.js as a runtime (not just dev tooling), add these fields:

```json
{
  "name": "your-package-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your project description",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./dist/index.js"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO#readme",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues"
  }
}
```

### Specifying Node.js Version Requirements

The template includes an `engines` field:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=22.0.0"
  }
}
```

Update this to match your project's Node.js version requirements.

---

## Gitignore Configuration

**File:** `.gitignore`

The default `.gitignore` file includes standard exclusion patterns for Node.js, Python, pre-commit, OS-generated files, and IDE configurations. Most projects can use it without modification.

### Excluding Lock Files

The `.gitignore` includes a commented-out option to exclude `package-lock.json`:

```text
# Lock files (optional - uncomment to exclude)
# package-lock.json
```

**To exclude lock files from version control:**

Uncomment the `package-lock.json` line:

```text
# Lock files (optional - uncomment to exclude)
package-lock.json
```

> **Note:** Most projects should keep `package-lock.json` committed to ensure reproducible builds. Only exclude it if you have a specific reason, such as always wanting fresh dependency resolution during installs.

### Adding Project-Specific Exclusions

To add custom exclusion patterns for your project:

1. Open `.gitignore` in your editor
2. Add your patterns at the end of the file
3. Use comments to explain non-obvious exclusions

**Example:**

```text
# Project-specific exclusions
data/
*.log
secrets/
```

---

## License Customization

**File:** `LICENSE` (and related files)

This template uses the MIT License by default. If your project requires different license terms, you will need to update multiple files to ensure consistency.

### Files That Reference the License

When changing your project's license, update all of the following files:

| File | What to Update |
| --- | --- |
| `LICENSE` | Replace entire file with your license text |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Update the "License" section |
| `README.md` | Update the "License" section (near bottom of file) |
| `pyproject.toml` | Update `license = "MIT"` in `[project]` section |
| `package.json` | Update `"license": "MIT"` field |
| `templates/python/pyproject.toml` | Update `license = "MIT"` (only if keeping the templates directory) |

> **Note:** The `package-lock.json` file contains `"license": "MIT"` entries, but these refer to the licenses of npm dependencies (not your project). These do NOT need to be changed when updating your project's license.

### Keeping MIT License (Default)

No changes required. The MIT License is suitable for most open source projects where you want to allow maximum reuse with minimal restrictions.

### Changing to Apache 2.0

Replace MIT with Apache 2.0 if you need explicit patent protection.

**Step 1:** Replace the `LICENSE` file content with the Apache 2.0 license text from [apache.org](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).

**Step 2:** Update all references:

```markdown
<!-- In CONTRIBUTING.md -->
By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed
under the same license as the project (Apache License 2.0).
```

```markdown
<!-- In README.md -->
Apache License 2.0 - See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
```

```toml
# In pyproject.toml and templates/python/pyproject.toml
license = "Apache-2.0"
```

```json
// In package.json
"license": "Apache-2.0"
```

### Changing to a Proprietary License

For closed-source or commercial projects, replace the MIT License with appropriate proprietary terms.

**Step 1:** Replace the `LICENSE` file with your proprietary license text.

**Step 2:** Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reflect contribution terms (replace `{{COMPANY}}` with your company name):

```markdown
## License

This project is proprietary software. By contributing to this project, you agree that:

1. Your contributions become the property of {{COMPANY}}
2. You have the right to make the contribution
3. You grant {{COMPANY}} all rights to use your contribution

Contributors may be required to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before
contributions can be accepted.
```

**Step 3:** Update `README.md` (replace `{{YEAR}}` with the copyright year or range, e.g., `2024` or `2020-2024`):

```markdown
## License

Proprietary - Copyright {{YEAR}} {{COMPANY}}. All rights reserved.
See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
```

**Step 4:** Update package manifests:

```toml
# In pyproject.toml
license = "Proprietary"
```

```json
// In package.json - choose based on your situation:
// Use "UNLICENSED" for internal/private projects with no license granted:
"license": "UNLICENSED"
// Use "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE" when you have a custom license file:
"license": "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE"
```

**Additional considerations:**

- Consider requiring Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) for external contributions
- Ensure employment contracts or contributor agreements assign intellectual property rights appropriately
- Review all open source dependencies to ensure their licenses are compatible with proprietary use
- Have legal counsel review your license terms before public or customer distribution

### Other Open Source Licenses

For licenses not covered above (BSD, GPL, LGPL, MPL, etc.), follow the same pattern:

1. Replace `LICENSE` file with the full license text
2. Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` contributor agreement
3. Update `README.md` license section
4. Update `pyproject.toml` with the appropriate SPDX identifier
5. Update `package.json` with the appropriate SPDX identifier

**Common SPDX identifiers:**

| License | SPDX Identifier |
| --- | --- |
| MIT | `MIT` |
| Apache 2.0 | `Apache-2.0` |
| BSD 2-Clause | `BSD-2-Clause` |
| BSD 3-Clause | `BSD-3-Clause` |
| GPL 3.0 | `GPL-3.0-only` |
| LGPL 3.0 | `LGPL-3.0-only` |
| MPL 2.0 | `MPL-2.0` |
| ISC | `ISC` |

For the complete list of SPDX identifiers, see [spdx.org/licenses](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

### Dual Licensing

Some projects offer multiple license options (e.g., GPL for open source use, commercial license for proprietary use). If dual licensing:

1. Include both license texts in `LICENSE` (or separate files like `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`)
2. Clearly explain the licensing options in `README.md`
3. Document which license applies under which conditions

---

## VS Code PowerShell File Encoding for Non-ASCII Characters

**File:** `.vscode/settings.json`

The template ships with this default encoding for PowerShell files:

```json
{
    "[powershell]": {
        "files.encoding": "utf8"
    }
}
```

This is the correct default for the common case and should be kept when:

- Your `.ps1` files contain **only ASCII characters**, or
- Your repository targets **PowerShell 7+ only** (which defaults to UTF-8).

### When to Change the Encoding

If your repository's PowerShell `.ps1` files:

- contain **non-ASCII characters** (for example, accented characters, CJK text, or special symbols in strings or comments), **and**
- must run on **Windows PowerShell** (v5.1 or earlier),

then you should change the VS Code workspace encoding setting for PowerShell files to UTF-8 **with** BOM.

### What to Change

In `.vscode/settings.json`, replace the `files.encoding` value for PowerShell files:

```json
{
    "[powershell]": {
        "files.encoding": "utf8bom"
    }
}
```

`utf8bom` is VS Code's identifier for UTF-8 with BOM (Byte Order Mark, `U+FEFF`).

### Why This May Be Necessary

When a `.ps1` file is saved as UTF-8 **without** a BOM, older Windows PowerShell versions may not detect the encoding correctly. Instead, they may interpret the file using the system's ANSI code page, which can cause non-ASCII characters in strings, comments, or variable content to be read incorrectly.

Adding a BOM lets Windows PowerShell detect that the file is UTF-8 and interpret it correctly. PowerShell 7+ defaults to UTF-8 regardless of BOM, so the BOM is unnecessary (but harmless) on modern PowerShell.

### Down-Level Compatibility Note

For very old Windows PowerShell compatibility scenarios, the safest portable strategy is often to **avoid non-ASCII source text entirely** when practical. If all characters in the script are ASCII, the file is interpreted identically regardless of whether the system reads it as UTF-8 or as ANSI, making the BOM question moot.

Relying on "ANSI" or locale-specific encodings (for example, Windows-1252 or Shift_JIS) is generally **not recommended** because those encodings are non-portable and brittle across systems with different locale settings.

> **Reference:** The full encoding rules are defined in the `### File Encoding` subsection of `.github/instructions/powershell.instructions.md`.

---

## Ongoing Maintenance

These are periodic maintenance tasks for repositories created from the template.

### Reviewing Upstream Template Changes

Repositories created from this template should review later template changes as a selective sync, not as a raw merge. Use the [Downstream Template Update Procedure](TEMPLATE_UPDATE_PROCEDURE.md) to add a `template` remote, identify the upstream range, filter changes by adopted modules, handle protected instruction files, and record the latest reviewed template commit.

### Updating Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks should be kept up-to-date for security and compatibility:

```bash
# Check for and apply updates to pre-commit hooks
pre-commit autoupdate

# Test that updated hooks work correctly
pre-commit run --all-files

# Commit the updated configuration
git add .pre-commit-config.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update pre-commit hooks"
```

**Frequency:** Monthly or when security advisories are published for hook dependencies (Black, Ruff, etc.).

### Reviewing Python Version Requirements

If your project uses Python, periodically review your Python support window:

1. Visit the [Python Developer's Guide - Versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) page
2. Check which versions are in "bugfix" status
3. Update `pyproject.toml` `requires-python`, Black `target-version`, and mypy `python_version` fields if needed
4. Update the CI workflow Python version matrix if needed
