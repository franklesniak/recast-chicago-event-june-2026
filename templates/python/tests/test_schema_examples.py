"""Starter template: validate schema example files with ``check-jsonschema``.

This file is **starter content** that downstream Python projects copy
into their own ``tests/`` directory. The active, canonical version
that this starter is derived from lives at
``tests/test_schema_examples.py`` in the ``copilot-repo-template``
repository — see that file for the source of truth on discovery,
invocation, and assertion logic.

The starter and the active test share the same essential pattern:

- Auto-discover schemas via ``schemas/*.schema.json``.
- For each schema, derive the example directory by stripping
  ``.schema.json`` from the file name (``schemas/<name>.schema.json``
  maps to ``schemas/examples/<name>/``).
- Recursively walk ``schemas/examples/<name>/valid/`` (must validate)
  and ``schemas/examples/<name>/invalid/`` (must be rejected).
- Invoke ``check-jsonschema`` via ``subprocess.run`` with
  ``check=False``, ``capture_output=True``, ``text=True``.

Intentional differences from the active test:

- Path resolution: this starter resolves the project root by walking
  up from this file's location until it finds a ``pyproject.toml``,
  ``setup.cfg``, or ``pytest.ini`` marker. The active test in the
  template repository hardcodes its location as
  ``<repo>/tests/test_schema_examples.py``; downstream projects may
  place this file at a different depth, so root discovery is dynamic
  here. See ``.github/instructions/python.instructions.md``
  (Filesystem and Paths): paths SHOULD be resolved from a clear root
  rather than the process CWD.
- The ``check-jsonschema`` skipif guard is retained so the starter
  remains safe to copy even into projects that have not yet added
  ``check-jsonschema`` to their dev/test dependencies. Downstream
  projects SHOULD add ``check-jsonschema`` to their dev/test
  dependency group (see ``templates/python/pyproject.toml``) so the
  test always runs.

How to use:

1. Copy this file into your project's real ``tests/`` directory.
2. Add ``check-jsonschema`` to your project's dev/test dependencies
   (already declared in ``templates/python/pyproject.toml``).
3. Place schemas under ``schemas/<name>.schema.json`` and matching
   examples under ``schemas/examples/<name>/{valid,invalid}/``. No
   per-case configuration is required — discovery is automatic.

Both valid and invalid examples are exercised here:

- Valid examples MUST validate cleanly (exit code ``0``).
- Invalid examples MUST be rejected (non-zero exit code).

Invalid examples are intentionally NOT wired into a normal
``check-jsonschema`` pre-commit hook, because a failing exit code from
the validator would be reported as a hook failure. Use this test (or
an equivalent script) to prove that the schema actually rejects them.

    Walks upward from ``candidate`` to ``root`` (inclusive), checking
    ``Path.is_symlink()`` at each step. Any symlink found on that path
    causes a refusal, which closes the symlink-rooted-discovery
    escape: a malicious symlink at, for example,
    ``schemas/examples/<schema-name>``, ``schemas/examples/``,
    ``schemas/``, or even ``schemas/<schema-name>.schema.json`` itself
    would otherwise survive a downstream ``os.walk(followlinks=False)``
    or a yielded-path-only ``Path.resolve().relative_to(base)`` check,
    because those checks examine paths *under* ``candidate`` rather
    than the symlink chain *to* ``candidate``.

    Also returns ``False`` if ``candidate.resolve()`` does not stay
    inside ``root.resolve()``, or if any ``OSError`` / ``ValueError``
    is raised while resolving (callers should treat such errors as a
    hard refusal rather than a recoverable condition, which is why
    they are caught here and surfaced as a boolean).

    This helper does **not** enforce a mount-point or device boundary
    (``Path.is_symlink()`` does not detect bind mounts). Downstream
    projects that require that level of isolation should layer an
    explicit ``os.stat().st_dev`` (or mount-table) check on top of

    Returns:
        ``True`` only when ``candidate`` resolves under ``root`` *and*

def _iter_safe_files(directory: Path, root: Path) -> list[Path]:
    """List regular files under ``directory``, refusing symlink escapes.

    Caller's contract: ``directory`` must be intended to live inside
    ``root``. This helper enforces that contract before walking by
    calling :func:`_is_within_root`, which rejects discovery if
    ``directory`` (or any ancestor up to ``root``) is itself a
    symlink, or if ``directory.resolve()`` escapes ``root.resolve()``.
    Without this pre-walk check, an attacker who controls a path
    component (e.g., a symlink at ``schemas/examples/<schema-name>``
    pointing outside the project) could coerce the test suite into
    walking and validating files outside ``root`` even though
    ``os.walk(followlinks=False)`` and the per-yielded-path
    boundary check would each, in isolation, appear to "succeed".

    Once the discovery root is accepted, walks ``directory`` with
    ``os.walk(followlinks=False)`` so that symlinked subdirectories
    are never traversed, drops any yielded entry that is itself a
    symlink, and re-checks each remaining path with
    ``Path.resolve()`` and ``Path.relative_to`` to guarantee its
    fully-resolved path string still lives inside ``directory``'s
    resolved location, which catches symlink and ``..``-style
    traversals that survive the initial walk-time skip.

    Downstream projects that copy this starter inherit the same
    policy: example-fixture discovery refuses any symlink-rooted
    escape (a symlink at any level from ``root`` down to the discovery
    directory), never follows symlinks during traversal, and never
    returns files outside the resolved fixture tree, so a malicious
    or accidentally-introduced symlink at any level of the
    ``schemas/`` tree cannot coerce the test into validating files
    outside the project.

    This helper does **not** enforce a mount-point or device boundary.
    A bind mount (or any other mount) located *under* ``directory``
    will still expose its target content because ``Path.resolve()``
    returns a path that, from the filesystem's perspective, remains
    inside ``directory``. Downstream projects that require mount-
    boundary isolation should layer an explicit
    ``os.stat().st_dev`` (or mount-table) check on top of this
    helper.

    Args:
        directory: Directory whose regular-file descendants should be
            returned. May not exist; if absent, an empty list is
            returned.
        root: Trusted ancestor of ``directory`` (typically
            ``PROJECT_ROOT``). Discovery is refused if ``directory``
            or any ancestor up to ``root`` is a symlink, or if
            ``directory`` resolves outside ``root``.

    Returns:
        A list of regular-file ``Path`` objects below ``directory``,
        in the order produced by ``os.walk`` (callers that need a
        deterministic order should sort the result). Returns ``[]``
        when ``directory`` is missing, fails the symlink-ancestor /
        containment check against ``root``, or contains no eligible
        regular files.
