## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive recommendations for implementing Terraform unit testing in CI for this repository. The goal is to establish a consistent, reliable, and maintainable Terraform testing workflow that:

- **Validates configuration logic** before deployment
- **Catches errors early** in the development cycle
- **Ensures module interfaces** work as designed
- **Verifies variable validation rules** function correctly
- **Integrates seamlessly** with the existing CI infrastructure

All recommendations in this guide follow the patterns established in this repository's existing Python and PowerShell CI workflows. This guide uses RFC 2119 keywords (**MUST**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**, etc.) to indicate requirement levels.

### Dual Purpose of This Document

This document serves **TWO critical purposes**:

1. **CI/Infrastructure Implementation Guide:** Detailed guidance on setting up Terraform testing in GitHub Actions workflows, test directory structure, CI configuration, and operational patterns.

2. **Content Specification for terraform.instructions.md:** Explicit recommendations for what testing guidance should be **embedded directly in the Terraform Copilot instructions file**, following the pattern established by the PowerShell instructions file's "Testing with Pester" section.

The distinction between these purposes is highlighted throughout the document where applicable.

## Part 1: Testing Framework Analysis

This section provides a comprehensive comparison of Terraform testing approaches to inform framework selection.

### Native Terraform Testing (`terraform test`)

**Official Documentation:** [Terraform Test Command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/test)

#### How It Works

The native Terraform test framework, introduced in Terraform 1.6.0, allows you to write tests in HCL using `.tftest.hcl` files. Tests are executed using the `terraform test` command, which:

1. Discovers all `.tftest.hcl` files in the current directory and `tests/` subdirectory
2. Runs each test file's `run` blocks in sequence
3. Evaluates `assert` blocks to verify expected conditions
4. Reports pass/fail status with detailed error messages

#### .tftest.hcl File Structure

Test files use HCL syntax with specialized blocks:

```hcl
# tests/basic.tftest.hcl

# Global variables for all run blocks
variables {
  environment = "test"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}

# Optional: Mock provider configuration
mock_provider "aws" {
  mock_data "aws_availability_zones" {
    defaults = {
      names = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
    }
  }
}

# Test scenario 1
run "validates_instance_type" {
  command = plan

  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.main.instance_type == "t3.micro"
    error_message = "Instance type mismatch"
  }
}

# Test scenario 2 with overridden variables
run "rejects_invalid_environment" {
  command = plan

  variables {
    environment = "invalid"
  }

  expect_failures = [
    var.environment
  ]
}
```

#### Capabilities and Limitations

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Unit testing (`plan`) | Validates configuration without creating resources |
| Integration testing (`apply`) | Creates and destroys real resources |
| Mock providers | Simulates provider behavior for isolated testing |
| Variable validation testing | Tests custom validation rules via `expect_failures` |
| Output verification | Validates output values in assertions |
| Module testing | Tests modules in isolation or as compositions |

| Limitation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Terraform 1.6.0+ required | Not available in older Terraform versions |
| Limited assertion operators | No built-in regex or complex matchers |
| Sequential execution | Test files run sequentially, not in parallel |
| Mock provider limitations | Not all provider behaviors can be mocked |

#### Pros

- **Native integration:** Built into Terraform CLI, no additional tools required
- **HCL-based:** Uses familiar Terraform syntax for test definitions
- **Mock providers:** Enables true unit testing without cloud access
- **Fast unit tests:** `command = plan` tests execute quickly
- **No language barrier:** No need to learn Go, Ruby, or Python

#### Cons

- **Version requirement:** Requires Terraform 1.6.0 or later
- **Limited matchers:** Fewer assertion options than full testing frameworks
- **Newer framework:** Less community adoption and examples than Terratest
- **Mock limitations:** Complex provider interactions may not be mockable

#### When to Use

Use native Terraform testing as the **primary testing approach** for:

- Variable validation rule testing
- Output value verification
- Configuration logic validation
- Module interface testing
- Any unit testing that doesn't require real infrastructure

---

### Terratest (Go-based Integration Testing)

**Official Documentation:** [Terratest on GitHub](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)

#### How It Works

Terratest is a Go library that provides helper functions for testing Terraform code. Tests are written in Go and executed using the standard Go testing framework:

```go
// test/vpc_test.go
package test

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestVpcCreation(t *testing.T) {
    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../modules/vpc",
        Vars: map[string]interface{}{
            "cidr_block": "10.0.0.0/16",
        },
    }

    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    vpcId := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "vpc_id")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, vpcId)
}
```

#### Capabilities

- **Real infrastructure testing:** Creates and destroys actual cloud resources
- **Rich assertions:** Full power of Go testing and assertion libraries
- **HTTP/SSH testing:** Built-in helpers for testing deployed applications
- **Retry logic:** Handles eventual consistency with configurable retries
- **Parallel testing:** Go test parallelization support

#### Pros

- **Comprehensive testing:** Tests actual infrastructure behavior
- **Mature ecosystem:** Large community and extensive documentation
- **Powerful assertions:** Full Go testing capabilities
- **Cross-platform:** Tests AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more

#### Cons

- **Requires Go knowledge:** Learning curve for non-Go developers
- **Slower execution:** Creates real resources, incurring time and cost
- **Complex setup:** Requires Go installation and module management
- **Cost implications:** Real resource creation generates cloud costs

#### When to Use

Use Terratest for:

- End-to-end integration testing of complete infrastructure
- Testing actual cloud provider behavior
- Verifying deployed application functionality
- Complex multi-resource dependency testing

---

### Kitchen-Terraform (Ruby-based Testing)

**Official Documentation:** [Kitchen-Terraform on GitHub](https://github.com/newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform)

#### How It Works

Kitchen-Terraform integrates Terraform with Test Kitchen, a Ruby-based testing framework. Tests are defined using InSpec profiles:

```ruby
# test/integration/default/controls/vpc_test.rb
control 'vpc-1.0' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'VPC Configuration'
  desc 'Verify VPC is created correctly'

  describe aws_vpc(vpc_id: input('vpc_id')) do
    it { should exist }
    its('cidr_block') { should eq '10.0.0.0/16' }
  end
end
```

#### Pros

- **Compliance-focused:** InSpec profiles align with security/compliance requirements
- **Readable tests:** Human-readable test definitions
- **Platform maturity:** Test Kitchen is a mature testing framework

#### Cons

- **Ruby dependency:** Requires Ruby runtime and gem management
- **Additional tooling:** Requires Test Kitchen and InSpec setup
- **Smaller community:** Less Terraform-specific adoption than Terratest
- **Complex configuration:** Multiple configuration files required

#### When to Use

Use Kitchen-Terraform for:

- Compliance and security testing scenarios
- Organizations already using Chef/InSpec
- Teams with Ruby expertise

---

### pytest-terraform (Python-based Testing)

**Official Documentation:** [pytest-terraform on GitHub](https://github.com/cloud-custodian/pytest-terraform)

#### How It Works

pytest-terraform provides pytest fixtures and helpers for testing Terraform:

```python
# test_vpc.py
import pytest

@pytest.mark.terraform('modules/vpc')
def test_vpc_creation(terraform):
    terraform.init()
    terraform.apply()
    outputs = terraform.output()
    assert outputs['vpc_id'] is not None
```

#### Pros

- **Python ecosystem:** Integrates with pytest and Python tooling
- **Familiar syntax:** Uses standard pytest patterns
- **Existing infrastructure:** Leverages Python CI/CD pipelines

#### Cons

- **Less mature:** Smaller community than Terratest
- **Limited features:** Fewer Terraform-specific helpers
- **Still requires apply:** Tests create real resources

#### When to Use

Use pytest-terraform for:

- Python-centric organizations
- Integration with existing pytest suites
- Teams with strong Python expertise

---

### Recommendation Summary

Based on the analysis above, this guide recommends the following testing approach:

| Priority | Framework | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary** | Native Terraform Test (`terraform test`) | Unit testing, variable validation, output verification, module interfaces |
| **Secondary** | Terratest | Integration testing requiring real infrastructure when native tests are insufficient |
| **Not Recommended** | Kitchen-Terraform, pytest-terraform | Unless organization has specific Ruby/Python requirements |

**Rationale for Native Terraform Test as Primary:**

1. **No additional tooling:** Uses Terraform CLI already required for development
2. **HCL familiarity:** Developers write tests in the same language as configurations
3. **Fast execution:** Unit tests with `command = plan` are quick and cost-free
4. **Mock providers:** Enables true isolation for unit testing
5. **Built-in integration:** Aligns with HashiCorp's product direction
6. **Lower barrier to entry:** No Go or Ruby knowledge required

**When to Opt into Terratest:**

- Tests require verification of actual cloud provider behavior
- Complex multi-resource dependencies need end-to-end validation
- HTTP/SSH connectivity testing is required for deployed applications
- Native mocking is insufficient for the testing scenario

---

## Part 2: Native Terraform Test Framework Deep Dive

Since native Terraform testing is the recommended primary approach, this section provides detailed coverage of its features and patterns.

### .tftest.hcl File Structure and Syntax

#### File Format Overview

Terraform test files use HCL syntax with specialized blocks. The file extension **MUST** be `.tftest.hcl`.

#### Complete Block Reference

| Block | Purpose | Cardinality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `variables {}` | Set global variable values for all run blocks | 0..1 per file |
| `provider "name" {}` | Configure provider for tests | 0..n per file |
| `mock_provider "name" {}` | Mock a provider for unit testing | 0..n per file |
| `run "name" {}` | Define a test scenario | 1..n per file (at least one required) |
| `assert {}` | Define an assertion within a run block | 1..n per run (at least one required) |
| `expect_failures` | List of resources/variables expected to fail | 0..1 per run |

#### Complete Syntax Reference

```hcl
# tests/comprehensive.tftest.hcl

# Global variables (optional) - Apply to all run blocks
variables {
  environment   = "test"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  enable_logging = true
}

# Mock provider (optional) - For unit testing without real infrastructure
mock_provider "aws" {
  # Mock data source responses
  mock_data "aws_availability_zones" {
    defaults = {
      names = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
    }
  }

  # Mock resource behavior
  mock_resource "aws_instance" {
    defaults = {
      id = "i-mock12345"
      arn = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-mock12345"
    }
  }
}

# Run block - Defines a test scenario
run "test_name_describing_scenario" {
  # Command type: plan (default) or apply
  command = plan

  # Override variables for this specific run (optional)
  variables {
    instance_type = "t3.small"
  }

  # Module reference (optional) - Test a specific module
  module {
    source = "./modules/example"
  }

  # Assertion blocks (at least one required)
  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.main.instance_type == "t3.small"
    error_message = "Instance type should be t3.small"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = length(aws_subnet.private) == 3
    error_message = "Expected 3 private subnets"
  }
}

# Negative testing with expect_failures
run "rejects_invalid_input" {
  command = plan

  variables {
    environment = "invalid"  # This should fail validation
  }

  # List of objects expected to fail
  expect_failures = [
    var.environment
  ]
}
```

### Test File Organization Patterns

#### Directory Structure

Test files **SHOULD** be placed in a `tests/` directory within each module:

```text
modules/
└── vpc/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    ├── outputs.tf
    ├── versions.tf
    ├── README.md
    └── tests/
        ├── unit.tftest.hcl           # Unit tests with mock providers
        ├── validation.tftest.hcl     # Variable validation tests
        └── integration.tftest.hcl    # Integration tests (apply)
```

#### Alternative: Tests Alongside Configuration

For simple modules, tests **MAY** be placed alongside configuration files:

```text
modules/
└── simple-module/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    ├── outputs.tf
    ├── simple-module.tftest.hcl      # Primary test file
    └── simple-module-edge.tftest.hcl # Edge case tests
```

#### Naming Conventions

| Pattern | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unit.tftest.hcl` | Unit tests with mocks | `tests/unit.tftest.hcl` |
| `validation.tftest.hcl` | Variable validation tests | `tests/validation.tftest.hcl` |
| `integration.tftest.hcl` | Apply-based tests | `tests/integration.tftest.hcl` |
| `<feature>.tftest.hcl` | Feature-specific tests | `tests/networking.tftest.hcl` |
| `<module>.tftest.hcl` | Module-named tests | `vpc.tftest.hcl` |

### Writing Unit Tests vs Integration Tests

#### Unit Tests (command = plan)

Unit tests use `command = plan` (the default) and **SHOULD**:

- Use mock providers to avoid real infrastructure
- Execute quickly (seconds, not minutes)
- Test configuration logic, not provider behavior
- Validate variable values and computed attributes
- Verify resource configuration before creation

```hcl
# tests/unit.tftest.hcl

mock_provider "aws" {
  mock_data "aws_caller_identity" {
    defaults = {
      account_id = "123456789012"
    }
  }
}

run "validates_tag_configuration" {
  command = plan  # Explicit but optional (plan is default)

  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.main.tags["Environment"] == var.environment
    error_message = "Environment tag not set correctly"
  }
}
```

#### Integration Tests (command = apply)

Integration tests use `command = apply` and **SHOULD**:

- Create real resources for full validation
- Be run sparingly due to time and cost
- Include proper cleanup (automatic with `terraform test`)
- Be separated from unit tests for selective execution
- Require valid provider credentials

```hcl
# tests/integration.tftest.hcl

run "creates_vpc_successfully" {
  command = apply  # Creates real resources

  assert {
    condition     = aws_vpc.main.id != ""
    error_message = "VPC should be created"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = aws_vpc.main.enable_dns_hostnames == true
    error_message = "DNS hostnames should be enabled"
  }
}
```

#### Separation Recommendation

| Test Type | Command | Speed | Cost | When to Run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `plan` | Fast (seconds) | Free | Every commit, PR |
| Integration | `apply` | Slow (minutes) | Paid | Pre-release, scheduled |

### Mock Providers and Mock Data

#### Mock Provider Configuration

Mock providers replace real provider interactions for unit testing:

```hcl
mock_provider "aws" {
  # Mock data sources
  mock_data "aws_availability_zones" {
    defaults = {
      names = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
      zone_ids = ["use1-az1", "use1-az2", "use1-az3"]
    }
  }

  mock_data "aws_ami" {
    defaults = {
      id = "ami-12345678"
      name = "mock-ami"
    }
  }

  # Mock resource computed attributes
  mock_resource "aws_instance" {
    defaults = {
      id = "i-mock12345"
      arn = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-mock12345"
      private_ip = "10.0.1.100"
      public_ip = "52.1.2.3"
    }
  }

  mock_resource "aws_vpc" {
    defaults = {
      id = "vpc-mock12345"
      arn = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/vpc-mock12345"
      default_network_acl_id = "acl-mock12345"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Override Mock Values Per Run

```hcl
run "tests_with_custom_mock" {
  command = plan

  override_data {
    target = data.aws_availability_zones.available
    values = {
      names = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
    }
  }

  override_resource {
    target = aws_instance.main
    values = {
      private_ip = "10.0.2.50"
    }
  }

  assert {
    condition     = length(aws_subnet.private) == 2
    error_message = "Should create 2 subnets for 2 AZs"
  }
}
```

### Test Assertions and Expected Outcomes

#### Assertion Block Structure

```hcl
assert {
  condition     = <boolean_expression>
  error_message = "<descriptive message when condition is false>"
}
```

#### Common Assertion Patterns

```hcl
# Equality check
assert {
  condition     = aws_instance.main.instance_type == var.instance_type
  error_message = "Instance type mismatch"
}

# Not empty check
assert {
  condition     = aws_vpc.main.id != ""
  error_message = "VPC ID should not be empty"
}

# Length check
assert {
  condition     = length(aws_subnet.private) == 3
  error_message = "Expected 3 private subnets"
}

# Contains check
assert {
  condition     = contains(keys(aws_instance.main.tags), "Environment")
  error_message = "Instance must have Environment tag"
}

# Regex match (using can() and regex())
assert {
  condition     = can(regex("^vpc-[a-z0-9]+$", aws_vpc.main.id))
  error_message = "VPC ID format is invalid"
}

# Null check
assert {
  condition     = aws_instance.main.public_ip != null
  error_message = "Instance should have a public IP"
}

# Boolean attribute
assert {
  condition     = aws_vpc.main.enable_dns_hostnames == true
  error_message = "DNS hostnames should be enabled"
}

# Output verification
assert {
  condition     = output.vpc_id != "" && output.vpc_id != null
  error_message = "vpc_id output must not be empty"
}
```

### Variables and Variable Files in Tests

#### Global Variables Block

Set variables that apply to all run blocks:

```hcl
variables {
  environment   = "test"
  project_name  = "testing"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
```

#### Per-Run Variable Overrides

Override specific variables for individual test scenarios:

```hcl
run "tests_production_config" {
  variables {
    environment = "prod"
    instance_type = "t3.large"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.main.instance_type == "t3.large"
    error_message = "Production should use t3.large"
  }
}
```

### Run Blocks and Their Configuration

#### Run Block Reference

```hcl
run "descriptive_test_name" {
  # Command type (optional, defaults to plan)
  command = plan  # or apply

  # Override variables (optional)
  variables {
    key = "value"
  }

  # Test a specific module (optional)
  module {
    source = "./modules/submodule"
  }

  # Override mock data/resources (optional)
  override_data {
    target = data.aws_ami.latest
    values = { id = "ami-custom" }
  }

  # Assertions (at least one required)
  assert {
    condition     = <expression>
    error_message = "Message"
  }

  # Expected failures for negative testing (optional)
  expect_failures = [
    var.environment,
    aws_instance.web
  ]
}
```

#### expect_failures for Negative Testing

Test that invalid inputs are properly rejected:

```hcl
run "rejects_invalid_environment" {
  command = plan

  variables {
    environment = "invalid"  # Not in allowed list
  }

  expect_failures = [
    var.environment  # Expects variable validation to fail
  ]
}

run "rejects_invalid_cidr" {
  command = plan

  variables {
    vpc_cidr = "not-a-cidr"
  }

  expect_failures = [
    var.vpc_cidr
  ]
}
```

    └── terraform/
        └── Example.tftest.hcl  # Recommended template (to be created)
```

> **Note:** The `templates/terraform/Example.tftest.hcl` file is a recommended template that **SHOULD** be created following the pattern established by `templates/powershell/Example.Tests.ps1`. See [Part 7: Integration with Repository Patterns](#part-7-integration-with-repository-patterns) for the recommended template content.

### Naming Conventions for Test Files

| Convention | Pattern | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional | `unit.tftest.hcl`, `integration.tftest.hcl` | Grouped by test type |
| Feature | `networking.tftest.hcl`, `security.tftest.hcl` | Grouped by feature area |
| Scenario | `basic.tftest.hcl`, `complex.tftest.hcl` | Grouped by complexity |
| Module-named | `vpc.tftest.hcl` | Named after the module |

**Recommendation:** Use functional naming (`unit`, `validation`, `integration`) for consistency across modules.

### Separating Unit Tests from Integration Tests

Unit and integration tests **SHOULD** be in separate files:

| File | Purpose | CI Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/unit.tftest.hcl` | Fast plan-based tests with mocks | Run on every commit |
| `tests/validation.tftest.hcl` | Variable validation testing | Run on every commit |
| `tests/integration.tftest.hcl` | Apply-based tests with real resources | Run on release/scheduled |

**Filter by File:**

```bash
# Run only unit tests
terraform test -filter=tests/unit.tftest.hcl

# Run only validation tests
terraform test -filter=tests/validation.tftest.hcl
```

### Module Testing vs Root Module Testing

#### Testing Modules in Isolation

Each module **SHOULD** have its own test suite:

```hcl
# modules/vpc/tests/unit.tftest.hcl

variables {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  environment = "test"
}

mock_provider "aws" {
  mock_data "aws_availability_zones" {
    defaults = { names = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"] }
  }
}

run "creates_vpc_with_specified_cidr" {
  assert {
    condition     = aws_vpc.main.cidr_block == "10.0.0.0/16"
    error_message = "VPC CIDR mismatch"
  }
}
```

#### Testing Root Module Configurations

Root modules (environments) **MAY** have tests verifying composition:

```hcl
# environments/dev/tests/environment.tftest.hcl

run "dev_environment_uses_small_instances" {
  assert {
    condition     = module.compute.instance_type == "t3.micro"
    error_message = "Dev should use t3.micro instances"
  }
}
```

### Test Fixtures and Helper Modules

#### Creating Reusable Test Fixtures

For complex test scenarios, create fixture modules:

```text
modules/
└── vpc/
    └── tests/
        ├── unit.tftest.hcl
        └── fixtures/
            └── mock-vpc/
                ├── main.tf
                └── outputs.tf
```

```hcl
# tests/fixtures/mock-vpc/main.tf
output "vpc_id" {
  value = "vpc-fixture12345"
}

output "subnet_ids" {
  value = ["subnet-1", "subnet-2", "subnet-3"]
}
```

## Part 4: CI Integration Recommendations

### GitHub Actions Workflow Design

Following the patterns established in the existing `terraform-ci.yml` workflow, test execution **SHOULD** be integrated as a dedicated job.

#### Workflow Structure

The existing `terraform-ci.yml` already includes a `test` job with appropriate design. Key elements:

```yaml
test:
  name: Test
  needs: validate
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Terraform
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
      with:
        terraform_version: "1.6.0"

    - name: Check for test files
      id: check-tests
      run: |
        if find . -name '*.tftest.hcl' | grep -q .; then
          echo "has_tests=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        else
          echo "has_tests=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        fi

    - name: Run Terraform Tests
      if: steps.check-tests.outputs.has_tests == 'true'
      run: terraform test -verbose
```

### Job Organization and Dependencies

The recommended job dependency chain:

```text
format → validate → lint (parallel with test) → security (optional)
                  ↘                           ↗
                    ----→ test ---------------
```

| Job | Depends On | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| format | none | Check formatting first |
| validate | format | Validate after formatting passes |
| lint | validate | Lint valid configurations |
| test | validate | Test valid configurations |
| security | validate | Security scan (optional, parallel with lint) |

### Matrix Testing Across Terraform Versions

For modules supporting multiple Terraform versions:

```yaml
test:
  name: Test (Terraform ${{ matrix.terraform }})
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      terraform: ['1.6.0', '1.7.0', '1.8.0']
    fail-fast: false

  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
      with:
        terraform_version: ${{ matrix.terraform }}

    - name: Run Tests
      run: terraform test -verbose
```

**Recommendation:** For this template repository, pin to a single version (1.6.0) for simplicity. Users can add matrix testing as needed.

### Provider Authentication for Integration Tests

#### Mock-First Approach (Recommended for Unit Tests)

Use mock providers to avoid authentication requirements:

```hcl
# tests/unit.tftest.hcl
mock_provider "aws" {
  # No credentials needed
}
```

#### Real Provider Authentication (Integration Tests)

When integration tests are required:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS Credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
    aws-region: us-east-1

- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: terraform test -filter=tests/integration.tftest.hcl
```

**Security Recommendations:**

- Use OIDC authentication (role-to-assume) over static credentials
- Limit IAM role permissions to minimum required for tests
- Use separate AWS accounts for testing
- Never store credentials in code or logs

### Secrets and Environment Variable Handling

```yaml
env:
  TF_VAR_environment: "ci-test"
  TF_IN_AUTOMATION: "true"

steps:
  - name: Run Tests with Variables
    env:
      TF_VAR_api_key: ${{ secrets.TEST_API_KEY }}
    run: terraform test -verbose
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use `TF_VAR_` prefix for Terraform variables
- Set `TF_IN_AUTOMATION=true` to suppress interactive prompts
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive values
- Never echo or log secret values

### Test Result Reporting

```yaml
- name: Run Terraform Tests
  id: test
  run: |
    terraform test -verbose 2>&1 | tee test-output.txt
    echo "exit_code=${PIPESTATUS[0]}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

- name: Upload Test Results
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: terraform-test-results
    path: test-output.txt
```

## Part 5: Test Writing Guidelines

### What to Test in Terraform

| Category | What to Test | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Variable validation** | Custom validation rules work correctly | Invalid environment rejected |
| **Computed values** | Locals and expressions compute correctly | CIDR calculations, name generation |
| **Resource configuration** | Resources have expected attributes | Instance type, tags, security settings |
| **Output values** | Outputs contain expected values | VPC ID not empty, ARN format valid |
| **Conditional logic** | Count/for_each behave correctly | Zero instances when disabled |
| **Module interfaces** | Modules accept inputs and produce outputs | Module composition works |
| **Edge cases** | Boundary conditions handled | Empty lists, null values |
| **Negative scenarios** | Invalid inputs are rejected | Bad CIDR, invalid region |

### What NOT to Test

- **Cloud provider behavior:** Don't test if AWS actually creates an EC2 instance
- **Terraform core functionality:** Don't test if `count` works
- **External service availability:** Don't test if the AWS API is up
- **Provider bugs:** Report to provider maintainers instead

### Test Isolation and Idempotency

Tests **MUST** be isolated and idempotent:

```hcl
# Good: Uses unique names via variables or locals
variables {
  name_prefix = "test"
}

run "creates_unique_resources" {
  variables {
    # Note: Using timestamp() can affect test reproducibility.
    # For CI, consider using a static prefix or run-specific identifier.
    name_prefix = "ci-test-unique"
  }

  # ...
}
```

**Principles:**

- Each test should be independent of others
- Tests should produce same results when run multiple times
- Use unique resource names to avoid conflicts
- Clean up resources after tests (automatic with `terraform test`)

### Handling Stateful Resources in Tests

For unit tests, use mocks to avoid state issues:

```hcl
mock_provider "aws" {
  mock_resource "aws_s3_bucket" {
    defaults = {
      id = "mock-bucket"
      arn = "arn:aws:s3:::mock-bucket"
    }
  }
}
```

For integration tests, rely on `terraform test` automatic cleanup:

- Resources are destroyed after each test file
- Use `command = apply` only when necessary
- Design tests to minimize resource creation

### Cleanup and Resource Destruction

`terraform test` automatically handles cleanup:

1. After each `run` block with `command = apply`, resources are preserved
2. After all runs in a file complete, resources are destroyed
3. If a test fails, cleanup still occurs

**For manual cleanup:**

```bash
# If automatic cleanup fails
cd modules/vpc
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

### Testing Modules Independently

Each module **SHOULD** have tests that validate its interface:

```hcl
# modules/ec2-instance/tests/unit.tftest.hcl

variables {
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  ami_id        = "ami-12345678"
  subnet_id     = "subnet-mock"
}

mock_provider "aws" {}

run "uses_specified_instance_type" {
  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.main.instance_type == var.instance_type
    error_message = "Instance type should match input variable"
  }
}

run "accepts_custom_tags" {
  variables {
    additional_tags = {
      Team = "Engineering"
    }
  }

  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.main.tags["Team"] == "Engineering"
    error_message = "Custom tags should be applied"
  }
}
```

### RFC 2119 Keyword Usage

The testing section **SHOULD** use RFC 2119 keywords consistently:

| Keyword | Testing Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **MUST** | Test file extension (`.tftest.hcl`), run block requirement, assert requirement |
| **SHOULD** | Test file location, unit test command, mock provider usage, variable validation testing |
| **MAY** | Integration test usage, test organization alternatives |

### Detailed Section Content Specification

The "Testing with Terraform Test" section **SHOULD** include the following content (adapting the patterns from the PowerShell testing section):

#### 1. Introduction Paragraph

```markdown
Terraform's native test framework (introduced in Terraform 1.6) provides a way to validate configurations without external testing tools. This section documents testing conventions that integrate with the coding standards in this guide.

> **Note:** Terraform tests require Terraform 1.6.0 or later. For older Terraform versions, consider Terratest or other external testing frameworks.
```

#### 2. Test File Naming

Document the required file extension and naming patterns.

#### 3. Test File Location

Include directory structure diagrams showing both preferred and alternative locations.

#### 4. Test Structure

Provide the HCL block reference table and basic test structure example.

#### 5. Test Assertions

Show assertion patterns with examples for common scenarios.

#### 6. Testing Variable Validation

Demonstrate `expect_failures` pattern for negative testing.

#### 7. Mock Providers

Show how to configure mock providers for unit testing.

#### 8. Unit Tests vs Integration Tests

Clearly distinguish command types and when to use each.

#### 9. Running Tests

Provide CLI commands for local and CI execution.

#### 10. What to Test

Include a table of what to test and what not to test.

### Example Content Structure

The following demonstrates the style and structure that **SHOULD** be followed (already present in terraform.instructions.md):

```markdown
## Testing with Terraform Test

Terraform's native test framework (introduced in Terraform 1.6) provides a way to validate configurations without external testing tools.

### Test File Naming

Test files **MUST** use the `.tftest.hcl` extension:

- `basic.tftest.hcl`
- `validation.tftest.hcl`
- `integration.tftest.hcl`

### Test File Location

Test files **SHOULD** be placed in a `tests/` directory within the module:

```text
modules/
└── vpc/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── tests/
        └── basic.tftest.hcl
```

## Part 7: Integration with Repository Patterns

### Updating the Testing Tools Table in .github/copilot-instructions.md

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file includes a Testing Tools table that **SHOULD** include Terraform. The current table already includes Terraform:

```markdown
| Language | Framework | Configuration | Test Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python | pytest | `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`) | `tests/` |
| PowerShell | Pester 5.x | Inline in `.github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml` | `tests/PowerShell/` |
| Terraform | Terraform Test (requires Terraform 1.6+) | Built-in | `modules/*/tests/` or `tests/` |
```

**Verification:** The Terraform entry is already present in the current `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

### Template Test File Creation

A template test file **SHOULD** be created at `templates/terraform/Example.tftest.hcl` following the pattern established by `templates/powershell/Example.Tests.ps1`.

#### What the Template Should Demonstrate

1. **File header comments:** Purpose, prerequisites, usage instructions
2. **Global variables block:** Setting test variables
3. **Mock provider configuration:** AWS mock with data sources and resources
4. **Basic run block:** Simple assertion example
5. **Variable validation testing:** Using `expect_failures`
6. **Output verification:** Testing output values
7. **Multiple assertions:** Showing assertion patterns
8. **Unit vs integration examples:** Both `plan` and `apply` commands

#### Recommended Template Structure

> **Implementation Note:** This template **SHOULD** be created at `templates/terraform/Example.tftest.hcl` as part of the Terraform testing implementation. The `templates/terraform/` directory does not currently exist and would need to be created.

```hcl
# Example.tftest.hcl
#
# TEMPLATE FILE: Copy this file to modules/<module>/tests/ and customize.
#
# This file demonstrates Terraform test patterns including:
#   - Global variables for test configuration
#   - Mock providers for unit testing
#   - Basic assertions with condition/error_message
#   - Variable validation testing with expect_failures
#   - Output verification
#   - Unit tests (command = plan) vs integration tests (command = apply)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Terraform 1.6.0 or later
#
# Usage (from module directory):
#   terraform test
#   terraform test -verbose
#   terraform test -filter=tests/Example.tftest.hcl
#
# For complete Terraform test documentation:
# https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/test

# ==============================================================================
# Global Variables
# ==============================================================================
# Variables defined here apply to all run blocks unless overridden.

variables {
  environment   = "test"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  # Add your module's required variables here
}

# ==============================================================================
# Mock Provider Configuration
# ==============================================================================
# Mock providers enable unit testing without real cloud credentials.

mock_provider "aws" {
  # Mock data sources
  mock_data "aws_availability_zones" {
    defaults = {
      names = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
    }
  }

  mock_data "aws_caller_identity" {
    defaults = {
      account_id = "123456789012"
    }
  }

  # Mock resource computed attributes
  mock_resource "aws_instance" {
    defaults = {
      id         = "i-mock12345"
      arn        = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/i-mock12345"
      private_ip = "10.0.1.100"
    }
  }
}

# ==============================================================================
# Unit Tests (command = plan)
# ==============================================================================
# Unit tests validate configuration logic without creating resources.

run "validates_instance_type" {
  command = plan

  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.main.instance_type == var.instance_type
    error_message = "Instance type should match input variable"
  }
}

run "applies_environment_tag" {
  command = plan

  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.main.tags["Environment"] == var.environment
    error_message = "Environment tag should be set"
  }
}

# ==============================================================================
# Variable Validation Tests
# ==============================================================================
# Test that invalid inputs are properly rejected.

run "rejects_invalid_environment" {
  command = plan

  variables {
    environment = "invalid"  # Should fail validation
  }

  expect_failures = [
    var.environment
  ]
}

# ==============================================================================
# Output Verification
# ==============================================================================
# Verify outputs contain expected values.

run "outputs_instance_id" {
  command = plan

  assert {
    condition     = output.instance_id != null
    error_message = "instance_id output must not be null"
  }
}

# ==============================================================================
# Integration Tests (command = apply)
# ==============================================================================
# Integration tests create real resources. Use sparingly.
# Uncomment when you have valid provider credentials.
#
# run "creates_instance_successfully" {
#   command = apply
#
#   assert {
#     condition     = aws_instance.main.id != ""
#     error_message = "Instance should be created"
#   }
# }
```

### Pre-commit Hooks for Test Validation

The repository's `terraform-fmt` hook already includes `templates/terraform/**` and `.tftest.hcl` files, so Terraform test examples are covered by format checks. The `terraform-validate` hook intentionally discovers directories containing `.tf` configuration files and does not treat a lone `.tftest.hcl` file as a validation target.

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml excerpt
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: terraform-fmt
    - id: terraform-validate
```

**Note:** `terraform fmt` already handles `.tftest.hcl` files. No additional hooks are required for test file formatting.

### README.md Updates

The repository README **SHOULD** include a testing section:

```markdown
## Testing

### Terraform

Terraform modules include unit tests using the native Terraform test framework:

```bash
# Run all tests
terraform test -verbose

# Run specific test file
terraform test -filter=tests/unit.tftest.hcl
```

Tests are located in `modules/*/tests/` directories.

## Part 8: Advanced Topics

### Testing with Multiple Providers

#### Multi-Provider Test Configuration

```hcl
# tests/multi-provider.tftest.hcl

mock_provider "aws" {
  alias = "primary"
  mock_data "aws_region" {
    defaults = { name = "us-east-1" }
  }
}

mock_provider "aws" {
  alias = "secondary"
  mock_data "aws_region" {
    defaults = { name = "us-west-2" }
  }
}

run "uses_correct_regions" {
  assert {
    condition     = aws_vpc.primary.tags["Region"] == "us-east-1"
    error_message = "Primary VPC should be in us-east-1"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = aws_vpc.secondary.tags["Region"] == "us-west-2"
    error_message = "Secondary VPC should be in us-west-2"
  }
}
```

### Testing Provider-Specific Resources

#### AWS-Specific Testing Considerations

```hcl
mock_provider "aws" {
  # Mock common AWS data sources
  mock_data "aws_caller_identity" {
    defaults = { account_id = "123456789012" }
  }

  mock_data "aws_partition" {
    defaults = { partition = "aws" }
  }

  mock_data "aws_region" {
    defaults = { name = "us-east-1" }
  }
}
```

#### Azure-Specific Testing Considerations

```hcl
mock_provider "azurerm" {
  mock_data "azurerm_client_config" {
    defaults = {
      tenant_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    }
  }
}
```

#### GCP-Specific Testing Considerations

```hcl
mock_provider "google" {
  mock_data "google_project" {
    defaults = {
      project_id = "mock-project-id"
      number     = "123456789012"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Generic Patterns

When writing provider-agnostic tests:

1. Mock all data sources your configuration uses
2. Provide realistic default values for computed attributes
3. Test resource configurations, not provider behavior
4. Use variables for provider-specific values (regions, zones, etc.)

### Continuous Testing Strategies

#### When to Run Full vs Partial Test Suites

| Trigger | Test Scope | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR/Commit | Unit tests only | Fast feedback, no cost |
| Merge to main | Unit + validation | Ensure quality gate |
| Pre-release | Full suite including integration | Comprehensive validation |
| Scheduled (weekly) | Full integration | Catch drift, provider changes |

#### Scheduled Testing for Drift Detection

```yaml
# Scheduled workflow for comprehensive testing
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday

jobs:
  integration-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
      - run: terraform test  # Full suite
```

### Test Coverage Considerations

#### What "Coverage" Means for Terraform

Unlike code coverage for programming languages, Terraform test coverage refers to:

- **Configuration coverage:** Percentage of resources/modules with tests
- **Validation coverage:** Percentage of validation rules tested
- **Output coverage:** Percentage of outputs verified
- **Scenario coverage:** Percentage of use cases tested

#### Measuring Test Effectiveness

| Metric | How to Measure |
| --- | --- |
| Resource coverage | Count resources with tests / total resources |
| Validation coverage | Count validation rules tested / total validation rules |
| Output coverage | Count outputs verified / total outputs |
| Branch coverage | Count conditional paths tested / total conditional paths |

#### Critical Paths to Cover

Tests **SHOULD** prioritize:

1. **Security configurations:** Encryption, IAM policies, network security
2. **Variable validation rules:** All custom validations should be tested
3. **Complex expressions:** Locals with calculations or conditionals
4. **Module interfaces:** All inputs and outputs
5. **Edge cases:** Empty lists, null values, boundary conditions

### Performance Optimization for Test Suites

#### Parallelization Strategies

While `terraform test` runs files sequentially, you can parallelize at the CI level:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    module: [vpc, ec2-instance, s3-bucket]

steps:
  - run: |
      cd modules/${{ matrix.module }}
      terraform test -verbose
```

#### Caching for Faster Tests

Provider caching reduces initialization time:

```yaml
- name: Cache Terraform Providers
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache
    key: terraform-providers-${{ hashFiles('**/.terraform.lock.hcl') }}

- name: Configure Provider Cache
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache
    echo "plugin_cache_dir = \"$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache\"" > ~/.terraformrc
```

#### Minimizing Provider Initialization Overhead

1. **Use mock providers** for unit tests to skip provider download
2. **Cache provider plugins** across CI runs
3. **Share initialization** across tests in the same directory
4. **Limit integration tests** to essential scenarios

---

## Assumptions and Validation Notes

This section lists Terraform features and behaviors that **SHOULD** be verified against current official documentation before implementation.

### Features to Verify

| Feature | Documentation Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `terraform test` command | [Terraform Test Command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/test) | Verify current syntax and options |
| `.tftest.hcl` syntax | [Test File Reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/tests) | Verify block types and attributes |
| `mock_provider` block | [Mock Providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/tests#mocking-providers) | Verify mock capabilities |
| `expect_failures` | [Expecting Failures](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/tests#expecting-failures) | Verify syntax for negative tests |
| `override_data`/`override_resource` | Mock override documentation | Verify per-run override syntax |
| CI action versions | GitHub Marketplace | Verify `hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3` is current |

### Version Compatibility

| Terraform Version | Test Framework Support |
| --- | --- |
| < 1.6.0 | Not supported (use Terratest) |
| 1.6.0 | Initial release of test framework |
| 1.7.0+ | Enhanced mock provider capabilities |

### Known Limitations

1. **Mock provider completeness:** Not all provider behaviors can be mocked
2. **Parallel execution:** Test files run sequentially
3. **State handling:** Integration tests manage state internally
4. **Provider credential requirements:** Integration tests require real credentials

---

## Summary of Recommended Implementation Steps

### CI/Infrastructure Implementation

1. **Verify existing workflow:** The `terraform-ci.yml` already includes a `test` job with proper configuration
2. **Create template test file:** Add `templates/terraform/Example.tftest.hcl` following the structure in Part 7
3. **Add sample module tests:** Create example `.tftest.hcl` files in any sample modules
4. **Update documentation:** Ensure README includes testing section
5. **Configure caching:** Verify provider caching is configured for test jobs

### terraform.instructions.md Content

1. **Verify existing section:** The "Testing with Terraform Test" section exists and covers most requirements
2. **Review Quick Reference Checklist:** Ensure all testing checklist items are present (currently they are)
3. **Add module test guidance:** Consider adding a checklist item for module testing
4. **Verify examples are complete:** Ensure all code examples are current and correct

### Template File Creation

1. **Create `templates/terraform/` directory** if it doesn't exist
2. **Create `Example.tftest.hcl`** following the template in Part 7
3. **Include comprehensive examples:** Mock providers, assertions, validation tests, output tests
4. **Add usage documentation:** Header comments explaining how to use the template

### Pre-commit and Tooling

1. **Verify `.tftest.hcl` formatting:** Confirm `terraform fmt` handles test files (it does)
2. **No additional hooks required:** Existing pre-commit configuration is sufficient
3. **Consider CI enhancements:** Optional matrix testing for multiple Terraform versions

### Documentation Updates

1. **Update README.md:** Add testing section with commands
2. **Verify `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:** Terraform is already in the Testing Tools table
3. **Cross-reference guides:** Link this guide from terraform.instructions.md if desired

### Validation Steps

1. **Review official Terraform documentation** for any syntax changes
2. **Test example configurations** locally before committing
3. **Verify CI workflow** passes with test job enabled
4. **Run pre-commit checks** on all new files
