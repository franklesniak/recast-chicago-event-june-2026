"""Validate schema example files with ``check-jsonschema``.

This is the **active, canonical** schema-example test for this
repository. It auto-discovers schema/example pairs under ``schemas/``
and verifies that:

- Every file under ``schemas/examples/<schema-name>/valid/`` validates
  successfully against ``schemas/<schema-name>.schema.json``
  (``check-jsonschema`` exits ``0``).
- Every file under ``schemas/examples/<schema-name>/invalid/`` is
  rejected (``check-jsonschema`` exits non-zero).

Discovery rules:

- Schemas are found via the glob ``schemas/*.schema.json``.
- For each schema, the example directory name is derived by removing
  the trailing ``.schema.json`` from the file name. For example,
  ``schemas/example-config.schema.json`` maps to
  ``schemas/examples/example-config/``.
- Only regular files under ``valid/`` and ``invalid/`` are exercised;
  directories and other non-file entries are ignored.

Paths are resolved from the repository root, which is derived from
this file's known location at ``<repo>/tests/test_schema_examples.py``
(via ``Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent``) rather than the
process current working directory, so the test behaves the same
regardless of where ``pytest`` is invoked from.

Invalid examples are intentionally NOT wired into a normal
``check-jsonschema`` pre-commit hook, because a failing exit code from
the validator would be reported as a hook failure. This test exists in
part to prove that the schema actually rejects them.

A starter version of this test is available at
``templates/python/tests/test_schema_examples.py`` for downstream
consumers of the template; the two files share the same essential
validation pattern.

    Walks upward from ``candidate`` to ``root`` (inclusive), checking
    ``Path.is_symlink()`` at each step. Any symlink found on that path
    causes a refusal, which closes the symlink-rooted-discovery
    escape: a malicious symlink at, for example,
    ``schemas/examples/<schema-name>``, ``schemas/examples/``,
    ``schemas/``, or even ``schemas/<schema-name>.schema.json`` itself
    would otherwise survive a downstream ``os.walk(followlinks=False)``
    or a yielded-path-only ``Path.resolve().relative_to(base)`` check,
    because those checks examine paths *under* ``candidate`` rather
    than the symlink chain *to* ``candidate``.

    Also returns ``False`` if ``candidate.resolve()`` does not stay
    inside ``root.resolve()``, or if any ``OSError`` / ``ValueError``
    is raised while resolving (callers should treat such errors as a
    hard refusal rather than a recoverable condition, which is why
    they are caught here and surfaced as a boolean).

    This helper does **not** enforce a mount-point or device boundary
    (``Path.is_symlink()`` does not detect bind mounts). Callers that
    require that level of isolation should layer an explicit
    ``os.stat().st_dev`` (or mount-table) check on top of this helper.

    Args:
        candidate: Path that the caller wants to use as a discovery
            root or as a discovered fixture. May be a file or a
            directory; need not exist (``is_symlink`` is well-defined
            on dangling symlinks).
        root: Trusted ancestor that ``candidate`` must live inside.
            Typically a constant such as ``REPO_ROOT`` or
            ``SCHEMAS_DIR`` derived from ``Path(__file__)`` and
            therefore not user-controlled.

    Returns:
        ``True`` only when ``candidate`` resolves under ``root`` *and*
        every path component from ``candidate`` up to and including
        ``root`` is a regular (non-symlink) entry; ``False`` otherwise.

def _iter_safe_files(directory: Path, root: Path) -> list[Path]:
    """List regular files under ``directory``, refusing symlink escapes.

    Caller's contract: ``directory`` must be intended to live inside
    ``root``. This helper enforces that contract before walking by
    calling :func:`_is_within_root`, which rejects discovery if
    ``directory`` (or any ancestor up to ``root``) is itself a
    symlink, or if ``directory.resolve()`` escapes ``root.resolve()``.
    Without this pre-walk check, an attacker who controls a path
    component (e.g., a symlink at ``schemas/examples/<schema-name>``
    pointing outside the repository) could coerce the test suite into
    walking and validating files outside ``root`` even though
    ``os.walk(followlinks=False)`` and the per-yielded-path
    boundary check would each, in isolation, appear to "succeed".

    Once the discovery root is accepted, walks ``directory`` with
    ``os.walk(followlinks=False)`` so that symlinked subdirectories
    are never traversed, drops any yielded entry that is itself a
    symlink, and re-checks each remaining path with
    ``Path.resolve()`` and ``Path.relative_to`` to guarantee its
    fully-resolved path string still lives inside ``directory``'s
    resolved location, which catches symlink and ``..``-style
    traversals that survive the initial walk-time skip.

    The repository constitution requires that file-discovery callers
    "reject path traversal and symlink escapes"; this helper
    centralizes that policy for example-fixture discovery so the test
    suite cannot be coerced into validating files outside the
    schemas/examples tree by a malicious or accidentally-introduced
    symlink at any level.

    This helper does **not** enforce a mount-point or device boundary.
    A bind mount (or any other mount) located *under* ``directory``
    will still expose its target content because ``Path.resolve()``
    returns a path that, from the filesystem's perspective, remains
    inside ``directory``. Callers that require mount-boundary
    isolation should layer an explicit ``os.stat().st_dev`` (or
    mount-table) check on top of this helper.

    Args:
        directory: Directory whose regular-file descendants should be
            returned. May not exist; if absent, an empty list is
            returned.
        root: Trusted ancestor of ``directory`` (typically
            ``REPO_ROOT``). Discovery is refused if ``directory`` or
            any ancestor up to ``root`` is a symlink, or if
            ``directory`` resolves outside ``root``.

    Returns:
        A list of regular-file ``Path`` objects below ``directory``,
        in the order produced by ``os.walk`` (callers that need a
        deterministic order should sort the result). Returns ``[]``
        when ``directory`` is missing, fails the symlink-ancestor /
        containment check against ``root``, or contains no eligible
        regular files.
